# Plant Recognition System Technical Documentation

## Overview

The plant recognition system uses a 6-modal descriptor analysis pipeline to extract, process, and classify plant features from photos. The system combines computer vision with neural networks for accurate species identification whilst maintaining efficiency for field use.

The system works in two stages: feature extraction using multi-modal analysis(this will be turened in to feature extractor model), then neural network classification through prototypical learning. The system handles both exact species matching and blind prediction with limited training data per species.

## System Architecture

### Multi-Modal Feature Extraction Pipeline

The system uses six different analysis methods to capture plant characteristics:

1. **Texture Analysis**: Multi-scale pattern recognition using Gabor filters, Local Binary Patterns, and statistical texture measurements
2. **Colour Analysis**: RGB, HSV, and LAB colour space analysis with histogram-based feature extraction
3. **Shape Analysis**: Geometric feature extraction including contour analysis, moments, and morphological descriptors
4. **Contrast Analysis**: Local intensity variation measurements and edge density calculations
5. **Frequency Analysis**: FFT-based spectral analysis for capturing periodic patterns and surface characteristics
6. **Unique Features**: Class-specific descriptor generation tailored to botanical discrimination requirements

### Neural Network Architecture

The classification system uses neural network designs built for plant feature processing:

```
Input Layer: Variable feature dimensions (1,500-20,000 features)
↓
Input Normalisation: Layer normalisation for training stability
↓
Feature Processing: Multi-head attention with residual connections
↓
Classification Head: Advanced dropout strategies with temperature scaling
↓
Output: Species predictions with calibrated confidence scores
```

## Feature Extraction Specifications

### Descriptor Generation Process

The system processes input images through the following extraction pipeline:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Background removal and plant-focused region isolation
2. **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Parallel extraction across all six modalities
3. **Feature Consolidation**: Intelligent selection of discriminative descriptors
4. **Quality Assessment**: Feature ranking based on botanical relevance
5. **Final Selection**: Adaptive selection of top-performing features (typically 1,500)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Raw Feature Extraction**: 15,000+ features per image across six modalities
- **Selected Features**: 1,500 descriptors for classification
- **Processing Speed**: 2-5 seconds per image on standard hardware
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for model inference
- **Accuracy**: 85-95% on trained species (varies by dataset size)

## Advanced Augmentation Strategies

### Traditional Augmentation Methods

Standard augmentation methods provide basic data variety:

- **Geometric Transformations**: Rotation, scaling, translation, and perspective adjustments
- **Colour Modifications**: Brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue variations
- **Environmental Simulation**: Lighting condition changes and shadow effects
- **Noise Introduction**: Gaussian noise and blur effects for robustness

### Feature Chunking Augmentation (Advanced Strategy)

The system uses a feature chunking approach that creates multiple analysis views from single images:

#### Chunking Architecture

```
Single Image Input
↓
Raw Feature Extraction: 50,000+ features across all modalities
↓
Intelligent Chunking: 33+ unique feature perspectives
↓
Chunk Types:
- Colour-dominant chunks (colour + texture + contrast)
- Shape-dominant chunks (shape + geometry + structure)
- Texture-dominant chunks (texture + frequency + surface)
- Mixed perspective chunks (balanced combinations)
```

#### Advantages Over Traditional Augmentation

1. **Preservation of Information**: No data loss from image transformations
2. **Analysis Variety**: Multiple feature views from single source
3. **Processing Efficiency**: Feature-level rather than image-level processing
4. **Cache Speed**: Reusable feature chunks for fast training
5. **Plant Accuracy**: Maintains scientific accuracy of plant characteristics

#### Implementation Requirements

- **Storage Method**: Efficient caching of feature chunks with metadata
- **Chunk Management**: Smart selection algorithms for best combinations
- **Quality Control**: Validation of chunk relevance and performance
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring chunk effectiveness across species
