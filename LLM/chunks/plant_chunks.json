This booklet was \nstarted as an aid towards teaching volunteers and workers how to \nidentify the Alien Invasive Plants inside the Kloofendal Reserve and \ndistinguish them from similar looking indigenous plant species.\nI have compiled this booklet on identification and control of AIPs with \nthe aid of experts as well as various people working on AIPs elsewhere \nin Johannesburg.\nI have been reluctant in the use of herbicides as they do have an impact \non life of plants, animals (insects) and fungi close to the AIP to be \ntargeted. Our methodology in removal of AIPs since November 2020 \nhas been mechanical in the form of simply pulling out small plants \nwhere possible and using tree poppers for bigger plants. Trees too big \nfor  removal by a tree popper have been sawn or cut down, bark \nstripped down to the roots if single-stemmed. Multiple-stemmed trees \nsimply cut down, with a two monthly follow-up  cutting away regrowth – \na few of such follow-ups are required for the tree to be starved and die. \nAlternatively, we use paint-on herbicide on cut multi-stemmed trees.\nMechanical control is a big task but, judging by the mixed success seen \nin previous use of herbicides in AIP control, the mechanical method \nlooks more effective and is far less harmful to the natural environment.\nIn a four months AIP control project starting in November 2020,  and \nsubsequent AIP control work in Kloofendal,  a daily record was kept of \nthe different species and number of plants removed of each species \nand their location in the reserve, initially in recording books."

This is a new technology we are developing for \nrecord keeping of work done.\nAs many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is more \nefficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just focusing on \none species.\nRemoving AIPs does not only involve removing the plants, rootstock \nand all where possible, but also removing the fruit with the seeds when \nthey have been formed.\nMy report  on work done November 2020 into 202, which includes  \nColleen van Rooyen’s contribution in recording location of AIPs in \nKloofendal,  can be accessed  at  \nhttps://kloofendalfriends.org.za/alien-invasive-plant/    \nThis booklet includes the South African declared AIPs, as well as non-\ndeclared invasive problem plants occurring in the Kloofendal Nature \nReserve.

    "text": "6\nWhat is the problem with AIPs?\n1.\nIt is against the law (NEMBA AIS Regulations – see below)\n2.\nAIPs replace our indigenous vegetation, sometimes in a big way! \nAlien invasive species, which includes plants, animals and other \norganisms,  are responsible for a quarter of South Africa’s \nindigenous biodiversity loss.\n                           \n                                                                                                        (3)                               \nPompom weed, Campuloclinium macrocephalum, invading grassland.\n3.\nAIPs take up a lot of water. Research has shown significant current \nwater losses due to the impact of alien invasive plants. It is \nestimated that the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) \ncurrently loses about ±38 million m3/annum through these \nimpacts (equivalent to the capacity of Wemmershoek Dam). \n4.\nAIPs often grow into big trees, thereby consuming extra lots of \nwater, as compared to our indigenous plants which mostly do not \ntend to get as big e.g. Black Woods, mature Black and Silver Wattle \ntrees, Eucalyptus trees, Pine trees etc. \n5.\nRiparian invasions use water in rivers and use can exceed the \nrainfall. Dense black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) invasion is \nestimated to result in a 90–100% reduction in annual river flows (3).\n6.\nAIPs are often poisonous, unpalatable, dangerous to animals and \nplants, such as  Cestrum parqui, Datura stramonium. Ripe fruits \nand seeds of some AIPs might be palatable to birds or insects, \naiding in the AIP’s seed dispersal.\n7\n7.\nAIPs are very good at invading natural areas, through a suckering \nsystem, multiple seed production, nestling close to indigenous \nplants while small, which offers the AIPs protection from the \nelements such as sun, providing shade from the drying-out, \nprotection from wind, frost, fire, and then overtaking these \nindigenous host plants once AIPs are big. \n8.\nThe AIP roots can be intertwined with the indigenous plant roots \n(Lantanas do that), competing with the indigenous plants for water \nand minerals in the ground, and with fungi and small creatures (eg \ntermites) essential for plants to  grow. \n9.\nAIPs can make the soil and water in which they grow unsuitable for \nindigenous plants to grow there (exuding germination or growth \ninhibitors substances from their roots into the ground and water – \ne.g. Black Wattle and Silver Wattle) a useful technique,  called \nAllelopathy, which allow the AIPs to eliminate competition from \ntheir neighbouring indigenous plants.\n10. AIPs have strong defence mechanisms making eradication difficult \ne.g. Lantana thorns, Pyracantha spines, Cestrum parqui’s \npoisonous fumes and sap, allergic reaction caused by hairs on \nBugweed, plentiful seeds such as Pompom weed, non-declared \ninvaders such as Amaranthaceae and Boraginaceae family have \nmultiple burry seeds which make work on AIPs in disturbed areas \nvery difficult.\n11. Suckering – shoots arising from the roots of a woody plant, often \nsome distance away from the main stem. (1)\n12. Coppicing – regrowth from a stump or stem that has been cut (1), \nsuch as Black Wood (Acacia melanoxylon).\n13.  AIPs do well in disturbed ground which is very common in human \npopulated areas, where ground is disturbed by usage, fences, \npaving, buildings, gardening.\n8\nOrnamental Invaders\nPlants having been brought from other countries for gardening \npurposes, because they look beautiful, having become invaders, when \nescaping from gardens. Their propagation is  made worse by \nhorticulturalists promoting these exotic plants over the indigenous \nones (1).\nIndigenous Bush Encroachment\nIn certain conditions, mostly overgrazing, indigenous vegetation \nincreases in such a density that virtually all other vegetation is \nexcluded, drastically reducing number of game to almost zero and \nmaking carrying capacity of domestic stock totally uneconomical (1). In \nKloofendal the bush encroachment is due to lack of fire, which is a \nnatural phenomenon on the Highveld.\nExamples of indigenous Bush encroachers in the reserve are:\nDiospyros lycioides\nLippia javanica\nLeucosidea sericea\nLopholaena coriifolia\nSenegalia caffra Acacia caffra)\nTarchonanthus camphoratus\n                                                                   (7)                                               \nDiospyros lycioides"

It is recommended to wear gaiters to \ncover socks and shoelaces. Hair to be covered by a hat, braids and \nloose hair to be tied back and covered by a hat. Suncream is \nrecommended, as well as bringing something to drink.\n2.\nWelding gloves (elbow high, thick leather gloves, usually blue) to be \nworn when working with prickly plants such as Lantana camara, \nSolanum sysimbriifolium, American Bramble, Scotch thistle as well \nas with plants that have allergenic properties such as Bugweed \nhairs and sap of Cestrum and Mothcatcher.\n3.\nDo not wear leather gloves when working on plants that have burs, \nas burs stick onto these gloves.\n4.\nRubber gloves and mask to be worn when using herbicides. \nProtective glasses optional – we do not use herbicide spray, only \nthe paint-on one.\n5.\nPeople working on the AIPs need to be warned that many plants are \ntoxic, so that, after working on these plants, hands need to be \nwashed before eating, also no rubbing of eyes or nose with \ncontaminated hands. \n6.\nAs many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is \nmore efficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just \nfocusing on one species.\n12\n7.\nSites with AIPs often seem to collect litter – litter should be removed \nfrom those sites, so plastic bags for litter collection and a  litter \npicker is advisable to take to the weeding site.\n8.\nA small First Aid kit (rubber gloves, cotton wool, gauze, clean water, \nantiseptic, and plaster of various sizes) is useful for possible minor \ncuts or abrasions whilst working on AIPs.\n9.\nDisposal of AIPs\ni.\nAIPs that have been pulled out roots and all, and branches \nthat have been cut, can be left on site to decompose, with \nthe exception of the Opuntias and Cereus.\nii.\nWhere manageable, fruit and seeds must be put in plastic \nbags (“bagged”), the full  bag knotted closed, and taken to \na garbage disposal site, where they will rot.  The fruit and its \nseeds must not be left on site, as they will sprout and grow \nagain. DO NOT attempt to burn dry seeds!

A \nlong, strong screwdriver can also be useful.\n▪\nSecateurs to cut away branches that are in the way. \n14\n▪\nSaw to cut down the tree, if herbicide is to be applied – we use the \npaint-on herbicide, not the spray, as spray can easily reach other \nindigenous plants as well as the person doing the spraying.\n▪\nLeather, elbow high welding gloves – for working on thorny plants \nsuch as Lantana and Pyracantha, and on poisonous plants such as \nBugweed.\n▪\nPanga/ Machete  to strip tree bark all the way around the stem (ring \nbarking),  from knee height, down to the roots – this should kill the \ntree, but still follow-up is required for possible coppicing.\n▪\nA basket is useful for carrying the herbicide, a small container with \nwater for the brush, small weeding tools, plastic bags for fruit and \nseeds, (bag above right, is full of Jerusalem cherries’ fruit -  small \nFirst Aid kit, notebook & pen and a small towel for wiping hands on\n▪\nHerbicide and brush – herbicide is only used if mechanical means \nand biocontrol do not work. \n15\n▪\nInformation on herbicides for AIPs can be found in “Problem \nPlants and Invasive Weeds in Southern Africa” by Clive Bromilow, \n2018 edition (1).

    "text": "167\nAbout the Author\nKarin Spottiswoode qualified as a FGASA 1 Field Guide in 2002, has \nbeen involved in field guiding ever since, obtained her FGASA 3 \nqualification in 2012. She assisted in training of field guides 2006 – 2009 \nwith Bushveld Training Adventures.\nShe was one of the founder members of the Friends of Kloofendal and \nstarted an Environmental Education Program in the Kloofendal Nature \nReserve over weekends for family groups, people of varied interests in \nthe natural environment in the form of two-hour guided nature walks \nwith different topics such as birding, wildflowers, trees & shrubs, \ngrasses, geology, insects, reptiles, frogs and a “hands-on” program for \nschool groups during the week. Her passion has always been plants \nand over the years she developed a growing concern in the increase in \nAlien Invasive Plants in the reserve, all over Johannesburg and in the \nMagaliesberg. The Environmental Education program in Kloofendal has \nfor the last eight years in part become focused on  identification of \nAIPs, distinguishing them from the indigenous similar-looking plants, \nand  trying out methods of controlling these invasive problem plants \nwithout using herbicides, to help the workers and students working in \nKloofendal in AIP control.\nThe aim is now to extend this work over the city of Johannesburg where \nAIPs have become a huge and growing problem.\n168"
