Introduction
This booklet is based on declared alien invasive plants and other 
problem invasive plants found in the Kloofendal Nature Reserve, which 
is in the western part of Johannesburg, and in the Magaliesberg 
mountains. 
As part of the Friends of Kloofendal, which was founded in August 2002, 
I have been very involved in the control of Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) in 
Kloofendal Nature Reserve for many years, supported by Johannesburg 
City Parks management of the reserve, members of the Friends of 
Kloofendal, other volunteers, students, scout groups and EPWP 
workers employed by Johannesburg City Parks& Zoo. This booklet was 
started as an aid towards teaching volunteers and workers how to 
identify the Alien Invasive Plants inside the Kloofendal Reserve and 
distinguish them from similar looking indigenous plant species.
I have compiled this booklet on identification and control of AIPs with 
the aid of experts as well as various people working on AIPs elsewhere 
in Johannesburg.
I have been reluctant in the use of herbicides as they do have an impact 
on life of plants, animals (insects) and fungi close to the AIP to be 
targeted. Our methodology in removal of AIPs since November 2020 
has been mechanical in the form of simply pulling out small plants 
where possible and using tree poppers for bigger plants. Trees too big 
for  removal by a tree popper have been sawn or cut down, bark 
stripped down to the roots if single-stemmed. Multiple-stemmed trees 
simply cut down, with a two monthly follow-up  cutting away regrowth – 
a few of such follow-ups are required for the tree to be starved and die. 
Alternatively, we use paint-on herbicide on cut multi-stemmed trees.
Mechanical control is a big task but, judging by the mixed success seen 
in previous use of herbicides in AIP control, the mechanical method 
looks more effective and is far less harmful to the natural environment.
In a four months AIP control project starting in November 2020,  and 
subsequent AIP control work in Kloofendal,  a daily record was kept of 
the different species and number of plants removed of each species 
and their location in the reserve, initially in recording books.  
4
These records were then transferred onto a spreadsheet for data 
processing. Since 2022 recording is done on a GPS App on the cell, and 
then exported via email to a spreadsheet for data processing which 
gives numbers of AIPs pulled out,  ringbarked or treated with paint-on 
herbicide, date and time,  with location on the Kloofendal map, an 
overlay for each species. This is a new technology we are developing for 
record keeping of work done.
As many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is more 
efficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just focusing on 
one species.
Removing AIPs does not only involve removing the plants, rootstock 
and all where possible, but also removing the fruit with the seeds when 
they have been formed.
My report  on work done November 2020 into 202, which includes  
Colleen van Rooyen’s contribution in recording location of AIPs in 
Kloofendal,  can be accessed  at  
https://kloofendalfriends.org.za/alien-invasive-plant/    
This booklet includes the South African declared AIPs, as well as non-
declared invasive problem plants occurring in the Kloofendal Nature 
Reserve. I have included some AIPs which do not occur in Kloofendal 
but do occur in other Johannesburg green areas such as Klipriviersberg 
Nature Reserve and in the Magaliesberg.

Functions of this book
1.
Create awareness for the need of AIP control, what harm is caused 
by AIPs invading our natural environment and Johannesburg in 
general. 
2.
Identification of AIPs and indigenous problematic invaders and 
encroachers in Kloofendal Nature Reserve, other natural similar 
areas in Gauteng and the Magaliesberg and in one’s own properties.
3.
Identification of AIPs needs to be done out in the field. The 
Kloofendal Nature Reserve could be used as a training venue.
4.
Learn about methodologies used in removing the AIPs with minimal 
damage to the natural environment.
5.
Learn about record keeping of plants removed, where and when, 
this also allows for observing productivity of workers and allows for 
a management plan for present and future work to be done, 
including the necessary follow-up, checking up how effective the 
AIP removal has been, and to continue cutting away new growth 
and pulling out AIPs where possible.
6.
Assist in an AIP management plan for Johannesburg.
7.
With the aid of knowledge and experience gained in training, create 
jobs in AIP control work in Gauteng and Northwest province.

What is the problem with AIPs?
1.
It is against the law (NEMBA AIS Regulations – see below)
2.
AIPs replace our indigenous vegetation, sometimes in a big way! 
Alien invasive species, which includes plants, animals and other 
organisms,  are responsible for a quarter of South Africa’s 
indigenous biodiversity loss.
                           
                                                                                                        (3)                               
Pompom weed, Campuloclinium macrocephalum, invading grassland.
3.
AIPs take up a lot of water. Research has shown significant current 
water losses due to the impact of alien invasive plants. It is 
estimated that the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS) 
currently loses about ±38 million m3/annum through these 
impacts (equivalent to the capacity of Wemmershoek Dam). 
4.
AIPs often grow into big trees, thereby consuming extra lots of 
water, as compared to our indigenous plants which mostly do not 
tend to get as big e.g. Black Woods, mature Black and Silver Wattle 
trees, Eucalyptus trees, Pine trees etc. 
5.
Riparian invasions use water in rivers and use can exceed the 
rainfall. Dense black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) invasion is 
estimated to result in a 90–100% reduction in annual river flows (3).
6.
AIPs are often poisonous, unpalatable, dangerous to animals and 
plants, such as  Cestrum parqui, Datura stramonium. Ripe fruits 
and seeds of some AIPs might be palatable to birds or insects, 
aiding in the AIP’s seed dispersal.
7
7.
AIPs are very good at invading natural areas, through a suckering 
system, multiple seed production, nestling close to indigenous 
plants while small, which offers the AIPs protection from the 
elements such as sun, providing shade from the drying-out, 
protection from wind, frost, fire, and then overtaking these 
indigenous host plants once AIPs are big. 
8.
The AIP roots can be intertwined with the indigenous plant roots 
(Lantanas do that), competing with the indigenous plants for water 
and minerals in the ground, and with fungi and small creatures (eg 
termites) essential for plants to  grow. 
9.
AIPs can make the soil and water in which they grow unsuitable for 
indigenous plants to grow there (exuding germination or growth 
inhibitors substances from their roots into the ground and water – 
e.g. Black Wattle and Silver Wattle) a useful technique,  called 
Allelopathy, which allow the AIPs to eliminate competition from 
their neighbouring indigenous plants.
10. AIPs have strong defence mechanisms making eradication difficult 
e.g. Lantana thorns, Pyracantha spines, Cestrum parqui’s 
poisonous fumes and sap, allergic reaction caused by hairs on 
Bugweed, plentiful seeds such as Pompom weed, non-declared 
invaders such as Amaranthaceae and Boraginaceae family have 
multiple burry seeds which make work on AIPs in disturbed areas 
very difficult.
11. Suckering – shoots arising from the roots of a woody plant, often 
some distance away from the main stem. (1)
12. Coppicing – regrowth from a stump or stem that has been cut (1), 
such as Black Wood (Acacia melanoxylon).
13.  AIPs do well in disturbed ground which is very common in human 
populated areas, where ground is disturbed by usage, fences, 
paving, buildings, gardening.

Ornamental Invaders
Plants having been brought from other countries for gardening 
purposes, because they look beautiful, having become invaders, when 
escaping from gardens. Their propagation is  made worse by 
horticulturalists promoting these exotic plants over the indigenous 
ones (1).
Indigenous Bush Encroachment
In certain conditions, mostly overgrazing, indigenous vegetation 
increases in such a density that virtually all other vegetation is 
excluded, drastically reducing number of game to almost zero and 
making carrying capacity of domestic stock totally uneconomical (1). In 
Kloofendal the bush encroachment is due to lack of fire, which is a 
natural phenomenon on the Highveld.
Examples of indigenous Bush encroachers in the reserve are:
Diospyros lycioides
Lippia javanica
Leucosidea sericea
Lopholaena coriifolia
Senegalia caffra Acacia caffra)
Tarchonanthus camphoratus
                                                                   (7)

NEMBA AIS Regulations
National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act
AIS – Alien Invasive Species
Law passed in 2014, updated in 2020
Listed invasive species are assigned to four categories:
Category 1a:
Species which must be combatted or eradicated
Category 1b:
Species which must be controlled
Authorized officials must be permitted to enter properties to monitor, 
assist with or implement the control of listed species
Any Category 2 listed species (where permits are applicable) which fall 
outside of containment and control, revert to Category 1b and must be 
controlled.
Any Category 3 listed species which occur within a Protected Area or 
Riparian (wetland) revert to Category 1b and must be controlled.
Category 2:
Any species listed under Category 2 requires a permit issued by the 
Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) to carry 
out a restricted activity (See Permit Applications.)
Category 3:
Category 3 listed invasive species are subject to certain exemptions in 
terms of section 70 (1)(a) of the NEMBA Act, which applies to the listing 
of alien invasive species.
Any Category 3 listed plant species that occurs in riparian areas, must 
be considered as Category 1b and the appropriate control measures 
instituted.

Recommended methodology on removing AIPs
Based on experienced gained on work done in Kloofendal Nature 
Reserve and Magaliesberg over many years.
1.
Wear clothing that does not attract burs such as Forget-me-not 
seeds, Black jacks, Burweed, grass seeds, so do not wear -stretchy 
material, nor knitted clothing. It is recommended to wear gaiters to 
cover socks and shoelaces. Hair to be covered by a hat, braids and 
loose hair to be tied back and covered by a hat. Suncream is 
recommended, as well as bringing something to drink.
2.
Welding gloves (elbow high, thick leather gloves, usually blue) to be 
worn when working with prickly plants such as Lantana camara, 
Solanum sysimbriifolium, American Bramble, Scotch thistle as well 
as with plants that have allergenic properties such as Bugweed 
hairs and sap of Cestrum and Mothcatcher.
3.
Do not wear leather gloves when working on plants that have burs, 
as burs stick onto these gloves.
4.
Rubber gloves and mask to be worn when using herbicides. 
Protective glasses optional – we do not use herbicide spray, only 
the paint-on one.
5.
People working on the AIPs need to be warned that many plants are 
toxic, so that, after working on these plants, hands need to be 
washed before eating, also no rubbing of eyes or nose with 
contaminated hands. 
6.
As many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is 
more efficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just 
focusing on one species.
12
7.
Sites with AIPs often seem to collect litter – litter should be removed 
from those sites, so plastic bags for litter collection and a  litter 
picker is advisable to take to the weeding site.
8.
A small First Aid kit (rubber gloves, cotton wool, gauze, clean water, 
antiseptic, and plaster of various sizes) is useful for possible minor 
cuts or abrasions whilst working on AIPs.
9.
Disposal of AIPs
i.
AIPs that have been pulled out roots and all, and branches 
that have been cut, can be left on site to decompose, with 
the exception of the Opuntias and Cereus.
ii.
Where manageable, fruit and seeds must be put in plastic 
bags (“bagged”), the full  bag knotted closed, and taken to 
a garbage disposal site, where they will rot.  The fruit and its 
seeds must not be left on site, as they will sprout and grow 
again. DO NOT attempt to burn dry seeds! Hot air rises and 
will take dry seeds with them, the breeze will disperse 
them, and a new hot spot of that plant will be created e.g. 
Pompom weed seeds.

Tools 
                                                                                         Tree popper used to “pop
                                                                                          out” Lantana rootstock  
Litter picker, secateurs, weeding fork, 
foldable saw and tree popper
▪
Tree popper to pull out, roots and all, young AIP trees and shrubs. 
Three sizes are available, the bigger size to be used on bigger 
plants. Tree poppers do not work on herbs as those have a fleshy 
stem, which breaks easily when trying to “pop” them out. 
▪
Strong small weeding tool – to dig out herbs and young shrubs. A 
long, strong screwdriver can also be useful.
▪
Secateurs to cut away branches that are in the way. 
14
▪
Saw to cut down the tree, if herbicide is to be applied – we use the 
paint-on herbicide, not the spray, as spray can easily reach other 
indigenous plants as well as the person doing the spraying.
▪
Leather, elbow high welding gloves – for working on thorny plants 
such as Lantana and Pyracantha, and on poisonous plants such as 
Bugweed.
▪
Panga/ Machete  to strip tree bark all the way around the stem (ring 
barking),  from knee height, down to the roots – this should kill the 
tree, but still follow-up is required for possible coppicing.
▪
A basket is useful for carrying the herbicide, a small container with 
water for the brush, small weeding tools, plastic bags for fruit and 
seeds, (bag above right, is full of Jerusalem cherries’ fruit -  small 
First Aid kit, notebook & pen and a small towel for wiping hands on
▪
Herbicide and brush – herbicide is only used if mechanical means 
and biocontrol do not work. 
15
▪
Information on herbicides for AIPs can be found in “Problem 
Plants and Invasive Weeds in Southern Africa” by Clive Bromilow, 
2018 edition (1). FroK uses Kaput gel, which is a water-based paint-
on herbicide.  The herbicide application and safety instructions 
must be followed. It is important to apply the herbicide within ten 
minutes of cutting the tree as it loses effectiveness if applied later. 
Kaput gel herbicide used successfully on Cotoneaster pannosus
▪
Big garden fork, pick and/ or pinchbar (gwala) – to assist in taking 
out AIPs with a big root system such as Lantana, Pampas grass, 
Phytolacca octandra,   Cyathula uncinulata (Burweed).
▪
Android (Smart) cell phone for recording purposes.
16
Need for recording work done on removing AIPs.
Work done must be measured to prove that work has been done.
Management plan – in order to know what plants are alien or other 
invasive problematic plants in the area of management, one needs to 
be able to identify the plants, hence this book.
Quantity or number of plants in that area – counting each plant of a 
species that needs to be removed - if numbers are too big to count 
individually, one has to estimate how many there are.
Location – where exactly these plants are growing – GPS recordings are 
far more accurate than just a description, but descriptions are useful 
additions. Recording methodology will be discussed in the next pages.
Same to be done on each invasive, problematic plant in the located 
area.
What tools are needed to remove the plants.
How to dispose of them – stop the spread of seeds or root suckers.
Workers to have a ‘hands-on” manager who ensures that the work is 
done properly. The manager needs to be familiar with the invasive 
plants to be removed, the methodology, the recording procedure and 
how to pass on work done by the workers onto their contractor and 
other management.
Follow-up – 3 monthly, 6 monthly or yearly, and recording of the 
hopeful improvement of the infested area. Comparison, this is part of 
the original management plan.
Ongoing recording of location and numbers of plants removed, as well 
as observations of the occurrence of other, new problem invasive 
plants in the area of work.
Forward planning – what should replace the plants taken out? 
17
Documenting AIPs removed in Kloofendal
The bulk of this book deals with qualitative descriptions of the AIPs, the 
why, what and how of control of AIPs.
The Friends of Kloofendal are developing methodologies to quantify the 
process of controlling AIPs, in terms of Where, How much and When.
Where - what place or position.
How much – How many and how big
When - at what date and time
We are using an Android Cellphone App called GPS Essentials to
record groups of AIPs removed from the Kloofendal NR as Waypoints.
Once the App is set up and a Waypoint is requested, we follow a few 
simple steps to check that the location accuracy is sufficient, namely
-
Checking that the location is accurately estimated, for example with 
the error (δ) is less than 10m.
-
Entering the common name of the plant(s)
-
The number of plants 
-
Any relevant comment
18
Documenting AIPs (Continued)
AIP removal has been recorded by more than eight people to date using 
the GPS Essential app.  The recordings are exported by email or 
WhatsApp to Dr Steve Spottiswoode as KML format file.  He reads these 
files and adds new records to a master CSV file using custom-written 
software. Further processing is under development to expand analysis 
and reporting of the data.  This includes clustering and filtering of 
locations in space and time.
We are experimenting with quantifying places where AIPS still need to 
be removed by entering a negative number in the place of the number 
removed.
A free on-line programme on https://www.earthpoint.us/ can be used 
to generate a file for plotting records in Google Earth.  This programme 
allows for a wider range of icons exported by GPS Essentials as well as 
colours and symbol sizes
Sample of CSV data and a spatial plot of recordings.

How the individual plant species are described 
Each page contains: - please see example on next page.
a) Latin genus and species name. 
b) Common name of each plant, mostly English name, at times also 
Afrikaans. 
c) Number allocated to the plant if it is listed on the South Africa’s 
National Invasive Species list 2020 edition.
d) Category if declared.
e)  Country of origin.
f)
Colour Photograph of each plant, including, where possible, 
distinguishing features such as flowers, fruit, leaves and if 
applicable, a description of smell and touch.
g) How to distinguish the plant from similar-looking indigenous, non-
invasive plants. 
h) Where generally found.
i)
Removal methodology (Treatment). My preferred methodology is 
mechanical or biocontrol, avoiding the use of herbicides.
j)
If parts of the plant or whole plant is poisonous, it is described in a 
red font. 
k) References are marked numerically according to References pages 
at the back of the book
The plants are divided into 8 colour-coded categories (2) :
Grasses, Trees, Shrubs, Herbs (not woody), Flat-growing herbs, 
Creepers, Succulents, Water weeds. 
Within each category, the plants are arranged in alphabetical order 
according to the Latin genus and species name.
Each plant is allocated one or two pages.

lobes at leaf base
P.australis’ inflorescence is 
more open and feathery.
Treatment
C. Bromilow suggests cutting 
the reeds to ground level, stack 
the  branches and preferably 
burn them. Caution not to use as 
stakes for the garden as pieces 
can regrow. Allow reeds to grow 
1-2 meters, which usually takes 
6-8 weeks, before applying a 
recommended systemic 
herbicide. Thorough follow-up is 
essential for effective control. 
Observe any restrictions on the 
herbicide label before  
subsequent water use. (1)

Cortaderia jubata
1b
Family:  Poaceae
Common names: Jubata grass, Pampasgras
Grass
Origin: South America
Vigorous, tussock grass up to 
3m in diameter, with flowering 
stalks up to 3m high. This grass 
invades open grassland, 
roadsides, riverbanks and 
wasteland. It was introduced 
into South Africa to stabilize the 
mine dumps and as an 
ornamental plant. (9)
                                                              
                                                              (9)
Leaves are bright green, with 
long slender blades, which are 
either flat or V-shaped. Margins 
of the leaves are sharp. Some 
people have allergic reaction 
(bad rash) to the leaves when 
trying to take out the grass. The 
flowers can cause irritation to 
eyes and nose and respiratory 
tract.
Where found?
It grows in the  goldmine and 
power station on eastern side of 
reserve and on the top Eastern 
part of Rocky Ridge (Yellow) Trail 
next to path.
Leaf blades are flat. Flowers are 
yellowish or purple, loosely 
branching inflorescence, flowers 
from November to February. It 
spread through its seeds. (9)
Treatment
Cut off the flowers before 
seeding, bag them, leave to rot 
in a closed- up garbage bag. Dig 
out stumps, which is a huge job 
because of its rhizomatous 
roots. We  find a pinch bar 
(gwala) useful in digging the 
plant out. First cutting off the 
leaves with a panga makes 
digging out the stumps easier.

Paspalum notatum
Family:  Poaceae
Common names: Bahia grass
Grass
Origin: Asia
A dense, mat-forming perennial 
grass spread by strong 
rhizomes and seeds.
It grows in any type of soil.
Rhizome, and 
flattened 
culm and leaf 
sheaths.
Where found?
Amphitheatre lawn, disturbed 
areas in the reserve such as 
next to paths.
In road reserves, lawns and 
gardens in towns and cities (6)
Inflorescence is a pair of 
racemes (“fingers”)= paired 
digitate.  pointing upwards. 
Spikelets are rounded, hairless, 
shiny with dark purple flowering 
parts sticking out. Flowers from 
December to April (6)
Not to be confused with
Paspalum scrobiculatum, 
Spaced-digitate, 
not paired digitate. 
A tufted grass, not 
a creeping grass.
Urochloa mosambicensis 
racemes are semi-
digitate. A hairy 
tufted grass with 
stolons. It likes light 
shade. 
Treatment
This weed should be controlled 
by physical removal before 
becoming established (1).

Pennisetum clandestinum
1b
Family:  Poacaea
Common names: Kikuyu grass
Grass
Origin: Tropical East, 
Northeast and Central Africa
Category 1b in protected areas 
and riparian areas. Otherwise 
not listed.
Dense, mat forming perennial 
grass, which spreads quickly 
from stolons (creeping stems 
above the ground), growing 
roots from their nodes - see 
picture above and below, 
rhizomes (underground 
creeping stems) and from seed 
spread by animals and 
waterflow. 
Where found?
Amphitheatre lawn, disturbed 
areas in the reserve such as 
Southern, upper part of reserve 
at sewerage leak site and place 
where building structures have 
been.
                                               (9)
Flowers – very small, hidden 
partly by leaf sheaths, only white 
feathery stigmas or anthers are 
visible (3)
Not to be confused with
Cynodon dactylon/ Couch grass, 
an indigenous grass, also with 
many stolons and rhizomes, but 
leaves are narrower and shorter, 
and inflorescence is true digitate 
(four or five terminal racemes/ 
“fingers”)
Treatment
Dig out, particularly near 
buildings, areas with tiling or 
bricks as Kikuyu grass manages 
to push its way under tiles, lifting 
them, and in between bricks.  It 
seems to be a host to many 
small ants.

Pennisetum setaceum
1b
Family: Poaceae
Common names: Fountain grass
Grass
Origin: North Africa 
A tussock-forming perennial 
grass with feathery, spike-like 
inflorescences. The bristles are 
long and detach with the 
spikelets.
Spreads by rhizomes and seed.
The inflorescence is about 10-
25 cm long and rose or purple-
coloured. (1)
Where found?
Roadsides and waste places. 
Introduced as ornamental grass 
from North Africa.
Strong pioneer forming stands 
along road verges and in other 
disturbed sites with the potential 
to spread into adjacent natural 
veld, replacing the indigenous 
vegetation. (9)
This grass is used for sand 
binding and as an ornamental in 
flower arrangements but is 
obstructive along roadsides.
(3) & (1)
Treatment
Bromilow (1) ) recommends 
industrial herbicide. In 
Kloofendal Fountain grass is not 
an invasive problem, so not 
treated as such.

Acacia longifolia
1b
Family:  Fabaceae 
Common names:  Long-leaved wattle
Tree
Origin: Australia and 
Tasmania, the long-leaved 
wattle was cultivated in South 
Africa for dune reclamation.
The Long-leaved wattle is an 
evergreen shrub or spreading 
tree 2-6m high. Like most 
species of Australian Acacias, it 
has phyllodes (enlarged, 
flattened, green stalks) rather 
than true leaves, which are 
mostly straight, but 
occasionally curved. (Wiki)
    
(10)
Phyllodes are bright green, up to 
180mm long, with 2-5 
prominent longitudinal veins.
Inflorescences occur singly or 
in pairs in the phyllode axils on 
stalks with a length of less than 
2 mm. The cylindrical flower-
spikes have length of 2 to 4.5cm 
packed with bright pale yellow-
coloured flowers, which flower 
between June and October.

                                    (25)                    (26)
In older Robinia pseudoacacias 
(right picture above) the leaves 
are pinnately compound, 
spines coming out at base of 
leaf stalks and also elsewhere 
on the stem. Simple and 
compound leaves are found on 
the same bush. It suckers freely 
and often forms thickets. (9)
Where found?
Infestation found on northeastern 
border of reserve, bordering on 
neighbouring gardens.

Typical white Acacia flowers in 
drooping sprays from 
September to November
Reddish-brown pods. 
                                         (8) 
Seeds, leaves and inner bark 
are poisonous.(9)
Not to be confused with
Acacias – most African Acacias 
have thorns, not spines (= stem 
ending in a sharp point).
Treatment
Tree pop the young trees. 
Cutting down tree and applying 
herbicide partly works, it does 
encourage more  suckering, but 
repeated cutting away new 
growth eventually does kill the 
tree.

Salix babylonica
Family: Salicaceae
Common names: Weeping willow
Tree
Origin: Northern China
One of the most prominent 
invaders of the Grassland biome 
of South Africa (3). They are a 
threat to replace the indigenous 
species. 
                                                  (29) 
Deciduous tree 5–18 m high; 
branchlets slender, hanging 
vertically, almost to the ground.
 
 
                          (29)                     (30) 
Leaves are bright green above, 
pale or grey beneath, 16 X 1.5cm 
with finely serrated margins, 
ending in a long tapering point.
Spring leaves are silky, summer 
leaves are hairless. They turn a 
gold-yellow in autumn.
The flowers are greenish, tiny, 
1mm long, arranged 
in catkins, produced early in the 
spring. Flowers are mostly 
female and stalkless. Flowering 
time is August & October.
Fruit are greenish, stalkless
capsules in catkins, shedding 
sterile white hairs.
It propagates by fragmented 
branches rooting along  the  
riverbanks.
Originally from Northern China 
but introduced into South Africa 
from Europe to prevent erosion 
of riverbanks (1).  It provides 
shade, fodder, honey source 
and helps to erosion control. (3)
Not to be confused with:
Indigenous Salix mucronata, 
whose branches may droop but 
not vertically, flowers and fruits 
are stalked, leaves pale whitish-
green beneath, without a whip-
tip; branchlets often reddish.
Where found?
Along streams in parks in 
Johannesburg.
Treatment
Unwanted plants should be cut 
down and replaced with 
indigenous species (1)

year round.
                              (9)                                      (9)  
Spherical berries which start off 
green and turn yellow, growing in 
compact terminal clusters.
Where found?
In disturbed ground.
Hairy leaves and stems are a 
respiratory tract and skin 
irritant. Unripe fruits are 
poisonous.
Not to be confused with
Vangueria infausta (Wild 
Medlar) young plants look 
similar, but Vangueria leaves 
don’t have the strong, 
unpleasant smell of the 
Bugweed.
Treatment
Pull out with tree popper if plant 
is young.
Bag fruit & seed.  Cut down to 
ground level, then paint on 
herbicide or, if single stemmed, 
debark with axe or garden fork. 
The bark peels off easily.

Where found?
Widespread, roadside and urban 
open spaces.
Pinnately compound leaves 
with bright green, smooth 
leaflets. 
Yellowish-brown, seeded, 
winged pods 50-60mm long.
Propagation by freely seeding 
itself – the tree has many seeds.
Treatment
Tree pop or dig out all 
unintended plants. For adult 
trees,  cut and paint tree stump 
with herbicide, or ringbark and 
strip bark down to the roots – 
not tried out in Kloofendal.

Ulmus parviflora
Family: Ulmaceae
Common names: Chinese elm
Tree
Origin: China, Korea, and Japan
Leaf margins are bluntly serrated
Where found?
Southern part of reserve. 
Common garden plant escaped 
into the reserve, and into other 
reserves and open areas.
This tree has the potential to be 
weedy through self-seeding in 
surrounding landscapes .
It has escaped intended 
plantings to invade native plant 
communities. The aggressive 
root system absorbs water, 
nutrients and space (Wiki) .
Ulmus parvifolia (Chinese Elm) 
is listed in the Invasive Plant 
Atlas of the United States 
(Gardenia.net).
Not to be confused with
Combretums, they also have 
winged seeds, but Combretum 
seeds are 4 winged, not two-
winged.
Treatment 
It can be effectively controlled 
using any of several readily 
available general use 
herbicides such as triclopyr or 
imazapyr (Wiki). No work has 
been done on these plants in 
Kloofendal yet, as there are only 
few there.

Cestrum parqui
1b
Family:  Solanaceae
Common names: Chilean cestrum
Shrub
Origin:  Brazil, Argentina, 
Paraguay
Evergreen, mostly hairless, 
shrub 1– 3) m high, producing 
suckers; bruised stems and 
leaves emit an unpleasant 
smell. It has a deep and 
persistent taproot (3). it invades 
gardens, rural lands and bush 
land. (9)
All parts of the plant are reported 
to be highly toxic. It is described 
as significant hazard to livestock 
(especially cattle) which may eat 
green Cestrum inadvertently or 
during shortages of other foods, 
often resulting in death (Wiki). 
Death is usually rapid and 
painful. (Wiki)
                                                                         (9)
Yellowish to dark green leaves, 
alternate, mainly towards ends 
of branches, narrowly elongated 
lanceolate, to 15 x 1.5–2.5 cm.

Family:  Solanaceae
Common names: Chilean cestrum
Shrub
Not to be confused with
Cestrum laevigatum (Orange 
Cestrum)
                                                              (31)
C. Laevigatum has bigger leaves, 
and flowers and fruit in axillary 
clusters towards ends of 
branches, not in terminal 
clusters. (31)
                                                                           (31)

C. parqui is better adapted to 
the cold highveld where it 
has been known along the 
Vaal River for many years 
although misidentified as 
inkberry (C. laevigatum)   
Beware of Chilean inkberry 
(C. parqui)! (31)

Cestrum parqui (cont.)
1b
Family:  Solanaceae
Common names: Chilean cestrum
Shrub
Treatment
We use tree poppers 
successfully to remove single 
woody-stemmed  young plants. 
It is important to get plants out 
before the intense suckering 
root system develops. Bromilow 
recommends chemical control, 
such as triclopyr and imazapyr 
painting onto stems or cut 
stumps (1). We were partially 
successful with  painting Kaput 
100 Gel on cut, woody, bigger 
branches of older plants using 
Kaput which contains the 
ingredient triclopyr. Cutting and 
poisoning young growth has not 
worked at all. The plants’ toxic 
smell made some workers sick.
Biocontrol for Cestrum parqui in 
South Africa has been 
researched by the Weeds 
Research Division of the 
Agricultural Research Council 
(ARC)  in Pretoria and is due to 
be released  as I was informed 
by ARC students in this field the 
2024 Yebo Gogga, Amablomma 
exhibition at the University of the 
Witwatersrand, May 2024.

Shrub
Origin: W. China
Unarmed, gracefully arching 
semi  ever green shrub upto 3 m 
high. (3)
                                                         (3)   
The leaves are oval-acute, 2–3.5 
cm long and 1–1.5 cm broad, 
shiny green above, downy below 
with dense whitish to yellowish 
hairs. (Wiki). Veins deeply 
impressed on upper surface. (3)
                                                         (32)
Flowers pinkish, about 1 cm 
across, in clusters of 5-15. (3)
                                                                                        
                                                                         (33)       
Fruits are red-orange pomes, 
usually with 3 seeds.
The fruit is eaten by fruit-eating 
birds who disperse the seeds in 
their droppings.
Fruits are poisonous when 
eaten in quantity.(3)
Where found
In gardens as hedging, 
ornamental and cultivated for 
honey. In Kloofendal amongst 
copses of indigenous plants.
Not to be confused with
C. Pannosus which has smaller 
and more plentiful berries, 
smaller leaves
Flower petals are white with 
spreading petals
Fruits of dull, deep red colour.

C. franchetii, which has: 
Bigger leaves, with yellow, gray 
or white felty undersurface.
Pinkish, not white flowers. 
Orange-red, not dull,  deep red 
fruit, with 3 not 2 seeds. (3)
Treatment
Bagging fruit is really not 
possible, there are simply too 
many! Seedlings we dig/ pull 
out, young trees we remove 
with the tree popper, trees we 
cut low and paint the stumps 
with herbicide (Kaput gel)  
which has been successful.

Treatment
Bag flowers & seeds.
Dig out small plants. For 
medium size plants use tree 
popper, which works well. Use 
secateurs to cut way branches 
in the way of taking plants out, 
then use tree popper to pull 
them out. Big ones cut down 
and paint herbicide on stump. 
No slashing as it will just 
coppice prolifically. Wear elbow 
length leather gloves for thorn 
protection.
Biocontrol is available, but only 
slightly reduces the rate of 
control.  (36)

Fruit, initially green, turning into 
blue-black berries, fruiting in 
winter. Leaves and fruits are 
poisonous to many animals, 
but some  birds eat the fruit.
Not to be confused with
L. lucidum, which is a taller tree 
(over 10 meters tall), has leaves 
that have elongated base and 
apex and L. lucidum’s leaves 
are bigger (6-12cm). Flowers are 
more tightly packed in L. 
lucidum.
Treatment
Young ones take out with tree 
popper. Older ones, bag fruit, 
cut down. Since stumps can 
easily regrow, regrowth to be 
removed every six weeks until

Heavily, scented small white 
flowers appear in large 
terminal, pyramidal panicles, 
15–20 cm wide and high, 
flowering from October to 
February. 
Shiny black berries.
Indigenous birds could neglect 
the dispersal of indigenous 
plants as a consequence of 
their preference for the fruits of 
this alien.
Not to be confused with
Ligustrum japonicum where the 
leaves are different and flowers 
less tightly packed, looser.
 
Treatment
As the Privets often occur along 
the water ways, we do not use 
herbicide. Tree-pop the young 
plants, bigger trees, saw down 
low, strip bark (ringbark) to the 
base where possible. Cut away 
regrowth to eventually starve 
the plants. Follow up.

Mahonia oiwakensis (= M. lomariifolia)
Family: Berberidaceae
Common names: Chinese holly grape, Burmese 
mahonia
Shrub
Origin: China, Taiwan
Evergreen Spiky bush, 1 to 7 
meters high,  growing in the 
shade in the forest.
The tall long leaves cluster near 
the stem ends.
Leaves are fiercely spiky (Wiki). 
Dark green above, yellowish 
green below, up to 45 cm long,

                                                            (82)
Tiny flowers with white petals, 
pinky-white sepals, flowering in 
early summer, in clusters above 
the leaves (Wiki).
The fruit is a bright red berry, 5–
10 mm diameter, ripening in 
late autumn and often 
persisting through the winter. 
(Wiki)
The plant is generally 
considered non-toxic to 
humans, but the berries are 
considered toxic to cats and 
grazing animals.
Berries are used in research as 
an anti-dote for Ecstasy 
(addictive dangerous drug). 
(Wiki).
Treatment
Not a problem in Kloofendal so 
far, so no work done on it, but 
my recommendation is bagging 
the fruit and digging it out.

Rubus cuneifolius & hybrids
1b
Family: Rosaceae
Common names: American bramble and hybrid 
brambles
Shrub
Origin:  North America
Erect to sprawling, thorny shrub 
growing up to 2 m high with 
deeply ridged stems. Spreads 
through seeds and suckering
It competes with and replaces 
indigenous woody and grassland 
species. Dense stands are 
impenetrable and restrict 
access to forestry plantations; 
they also restrict access to 
grazing and water by domestic 
and wild animals.
                                                              (3)
Leaves are green, sometimes 
densely grey-downy beneath; 
usually 3-foliolate, sometimes 
also 5-foliolate (lateral leaves re-
divided) on new season’s 
growth.(3)
                        (9)                                     (3)
Flowers are white, rarely pink, 
petals much longer than sepals; 
few,2–5(–10) at the end of short

Rubus cuneifolius & hybrids (cont.)
1b
Family: Rosaceae
Common names: American bramble and hybrid 
brambles
Shrub
Treatment
Cut prickly branches wearing 
thick leather welding gloves, 
elbow high,  for protection and 
pull, dig out, where possible 
removing the underground 
runners.
Mechanical control alone might 
help to suppress Rubus species 
but will not eradicate the plants. 
Parts of stems and roots have 
the potential to grow into new 
plants and therefore a single 
mechanical operation might 
actually promote spread. (43) 
Several herbicides have been 
registered for use against Rubus 
species,  mainly as foliar 
applications to actively growing 
plants. (43)
There are no biological control 
agents (insects or pathogens) 
available for any of the Rubus 
species in South Africa. (43)

Sambucus canadensis
1b
Family: Caprifoliaceae
Common names: Canadian elder, American (or 
sweet) elder
Shrub
Origin: Eastern and Midwestern 
United States of America

The Canada elderberry is a large 
flowering shrub with multiple 
stems.
The roots, stems, leaves and 
bark are very toxic.
Compound leaf with finely 
serrated leaflets. The upper 
surface of the leaflet is a darker 
green and the underside is a 
paler green with fine white hairs 
on the veins. (9)
Where found?
In wetland.
The creamy-white flowers are 
small. 
                                                        (9)
The fruit is a small berry-like 
drupe, which begins green, then 
turns reddish and eventually 
purplish-black. 
Treatment
Tree pop small plants, bigger 
trees, cut low and damage 
stump, strip bark to the roots 
with a panga - we are trying out 
that method as Sambucus is 
growing in the wetland, so we 
do not use herbicide there.

Seriphium plumosum/ Stoebe vulgaris
Family: Asteraceae
Common names: Bankrupt bush, Slangbos
Shrub
Origin: An indigenous bush 
encroacher. It is not an invasive 
species. (46)
                                                                           (47)
A sprawling, much-branched, 
grey shrub. Looking closer, one 
notices that the slender, wiry 
branches are softly woody and 
at right angles to the stem. The 
short shoots are covered with 
whitish, woolly, clustered 
leaves, which are minute, tufted 
and pressed to the stem, giving 
the plant a granular appearance 
(SANBI)
It invades arid and semi-arid 
grasslands. As it is unpalatable, 
it reduces the carrying capacity 
there.
Where found?
Throughout reserve, part of 
biodiversity, not considered a 
problematic encroacher plant in 
the reserve.

                                                          (7)
Treatment
Salt can be sprinkled at the 
base of each stem; it alters the 
salinity enough to inhibit 
growth.
Thick infestations can be 
burned, regrowth sprayed and 
slashed. Follow-up treatments 
and the adoption of proper land 
management practices are 
critical factors for long-term 
control. (1)

Sesbania punicea
1b
Family: Fabaceae
Common names: Red sesbania, Brazilian glory pea, 
Coffee weed, Rattlepod, Rooisesbania
Shrub
Origin: South America
A deciduous shrub or small tree 
up to 4m high with many slender 
branches. Drooping, dark green 
pinnately compound  leaves with 
oblong leaflets that end in tiny, 
pointed tips. (9)

dense sprays up to 25cm long 
flowering from September to 
March. (9)
Where found?
Wetland stream.

 Four-winged pods 6-8cm long 
and 10mm wide, initially green, 
turning brown with growing 
mature.
Seeds, leaves and flowers are 
poisonous. (9)
Treatment
Biological control by means of a 
beetle from Argentina is proving 
to be very effective, which is 
fortunate as chemical methods 
have failed and slashing it 
causes vigorous regrowth, so 
treatment, if no biological 
control is used, is physically 
removing the plants, best done 
after the spring flush when the 
plants have  exhausted their 
root reserves (1). Problem in 
Kloofendal is small, so pulling 
out with tree popper works well.

Seedpods, initially green, 
turning brown, splitting open to 
release papery winged seeds. (9)
Treatment
Remove seed pods and bag 
them. Cutting down the multi-
stemmed bush with loppers, 
secateurs and saw, trying tree 
popping and digging out has not 
worked for us.
Bromilow, (1) does state that T. 
stans is very difficult to control 
with herbicides. We will 
probably experiment  painting 
herbicide on freshly cut stems, 
see if it works.

Achyranthes aspera
Family: Amaranthaceae
Common names: Chaff flower, haak-en-steek-
bossie
Herb
Origin: Pantropical – no clear 
origin, found everywhere.
            
                                                                      (3)
Achyranthes aspera is an erect, 
sometimes sprawling, long-lived 
herb which can grow up to 2 m 
tall, with stems becoming woody 
at the base. Its short-stalked 
leaves are opposite, simple and 
egg-shaped; they can be densely 
to sparsely hairy and are dark 
green above and paler below, 
with young leaves often 
silvery.(49) 
Where found?
Next to paths, particularly in the 
Wetland area, in shady places.
                                                    (48)
The small greenish-white 
flowers, often tinged with 
purple-red, form terminal 
spikes, dense at first but 
elongating up to 60 cm long. As 
the flowers age, they bend 
downwards and become 
pressed closely against the 
stem. (49)
The fruits are small one-seeded 
capsules, orange to reddish 
purple or straw-brown; with 
their pointed tips, they readily 
adhere to animals and clothing. 
(48). 
Treatment
Easily controlled by cultivation 
i.e. just pull/ dig out and leave 
to dry out, plant will eventually 
become compost. Preferably 
pull out before seeding as the 
seeds are sharp and penetrate 
the skin if handled carelessly.

Herb
Origin: Central America 
(Mexico). 
Perennial herb or soft shrub up 
to 2 meters high,  stems  and 
petioles purplish red, stems 
hairy. Stems may be galled. 
Broken branches have a strong, 
unpleasant smell.
Grows in or near water, stems 
creep in lower parts of the 
plants, rooting at the nodes.
This plant is poisonous, causes 
chronic pulmonary disease in 
horses (3).
Where found?
In Kloofendal stream near Topaz 
street, where stream enters 
Kloofendal Reserve. Abundant in 
Wilgespruit stream along 
Christiaan de Wet Road and in 
Magaliesberg streams
                                           (9)
Leaves tapering at the base 
towards an ovate tip, with 
serrated margins along the 
distal 2/3rds.
Flowers are white in terminal 
clusters flowering from August 
to December. Not to be 
confused with Plectranthus, 
broken branches of which have 
a pleasant smell.
Treatment
Try to eradicate before 
flowering. Uproot plant by 
grabbing hold of base & pulling. 
If it does not come out easily, 
cut off roots close to the plant 
base & use tool to lever it out. 
Roots left behind will not grow 
again, but buried stems will. 
Discard on dry rock away far 
enough from the stream so that 
the plant cannot be swept back 
into stream.(5)

cycle (germination to shedding 
of seeds) in as little as 50 days. 
Viable seeds may be produced 
when the plant is a few cm high. 
Uses  from the internet:
(i)Treatment for stinging nettle 
and other skin inflammation, 
rub the plant onto the affected 
area.
(ii) Young leaves are eaten as a 
spinach by some people (1). To 
me it tastes bland.
Treatment
Ruderal weed, pioneer. 
Indigenous plants will take over 
in natural succession but in 
disturbed areas the Blackjack 
can spread effusively and grow 
high. We suggest slashing the 
plants  about 15cm high before 
they seed. This will keep the 
ground covered with vegetation 
preventing seeds lying around 
to germinate.
Pulling out plants will promote 
unwanted new growth in the 
loosened soil. Pulling out the 
odd plant amongst indigenous 
vegetation is good, as that 
allows the indigenous 
vegetation to replace the 
Blackjacks.

Campuloclinium macrocephalum
1b
Family: Asteraceae
Common names: Pompom weed
Herb
Origin: Central and South 
America.
A tall erect perennial herb plant.
Leaves are concentrated at the 
base of the plant with a single 
flower stem growing upwards. (9) 
Leaves and branches have 
rough, bristly hairs. Leaves are 
light green, are lance shaped 
and have serrated margins.
Where found?
All over Kloofendal amongst 
grasses in sunny areas in rocky 
ground.
The crown at the base of the 
stem has roots and succulent 
tubers (storage organs)  growing 
from it  (46).
                                                          (3)

Campuloclinium macrocephalum 
(cont.)
1b
Family: Campuloclinium macrocephalum
Common names: Pompom weed
Herb
Tall stems up to 1.3 meters high.
                                                                    (9)
Seeds become brown when ripe, 
fall off the flower very easily.
                                                                          (54)
Lack of control will result in 
grassland being totally replaced 
by Pompoms.
Treatment
Bag seeds & flowers & dig out 
plants, make sure that the root 
crown is removed, as the roots 
without the crown will not grow 
again. 
Bags of Pompom seeds to be 
knotted closed and left to rot. 
They decompose well. 
Crown and roots must be dug 
out and hung upside down on 
other vegetation to dry out and 
die. 
No slashing.
Ongoing follow-up during the 
flowering season is essential.(5)
Leather gloves are 
recommended as leaves and 
stems have coarse hairs.
Biocontrol is available (36)

Cirsium vulgare
1b
Family: Asteraceae
Common names: Scotch thistle, Spear thistle
Herb
Origin: Europe, Asia and North 
Africa. (9)
Spiny, herbaceous biennial 
which forms a large, flat rosette 
of leaves and a deep tap root in 
the first year and numerous 
branched stems up to 1,5m high 
in the second year
                                                                (3)
Leaves are dark green with stiff 
hairs above, white woolly 
beneath, deeply lobed, the lobes 
ending in strong
spines (3).
Stems have spiny wings (9)
It causes heavy infestations that 
reduce the carrying capacity of 
the veld and can cause injury to 
man and animals. (9) The sap is 
an irritant to skin, causes 
dermatitis in humans (3)
Where found?
Wetland and area adjacent to 
neighbours on N/E side of 
wetland.
                                                                          (9)
Pink to mauve thistle-like 
flowers surrounded by spiny 
bracts appearing  from 
September to April. 
Each small fluffy unit (A) is an 
unopened tiny fruit (Achenes) 
within a tuft of silky hairs of 2cm 
long.  Fruits will open up once 
on the ground, releasing its 
seeds.
Treatment: Remove plants 
before flowering. Once seeded, 
it is recommended to bag the 
seed heads, cut away spiny 
leaves, then dig the plant out of 
the ground. One needs to wear 
thick leather gloves for 
protection against the spines.

Conyza sumatrensis var. sumatrensis/
Conyza albida
Family: Asteraceae
Common names: Tall fleabane
Herb
Origin: America
Annual major weed over 2 
meters high. Growing in gardens, 
along the roadside, fallow land, 
forests and can infest perennial 
crops and is known to host the 
tomato spotted wilt virus, known 
as  “Kromnek” in tomatoes, 
potatoes, tobacco  and peas (1).
Where found?
Wetland and in grassy areas,  
replacing grasses.
                                                           (98)
Lots of fluffy seeds. 
Treatment
Conyza sumatrensis is a 
pioneer, a ruderal weed, which 
should get overtaken by 
indigenous vegetation. In 
Kloofendal, however, it is 
overtaking the grasses, so 
pulling them out gives grasses 
more chance to come back. We 
have not tried this yet.
Bromilow suggests the use of 
herbicides if Conyza  becomes 
a problem (1).

Where found?
Around Dassie Rock on Dassie 
Trail (red route). Burrs stick onto 
dassie fur, so seeds are easily 
spread.                                                  
                                                    (55)
Many very small flowers in a 
spike-like inflorescence,

Cyathula uncinulata
Family: Amaranthaceae
Common names: Ronde klits, Burr weed
Herb
Origin: Tropical Africa and 
South Africa, excluding Gauteng 
& Northwest province. (Wiki)
A perennial weed with burrs that 
contaminate hair & wool of 
animals with consequent 
downgrading (53) 
Burrs on these plants often 
obstruct removing  the declared 
Alien Invasive Plants, hence the 
need to remove them in order to 
gain access.
Where found?
In the wetland, below Dassie 
Rock, in the forest under trees.
The leaves are furry and soft, 
they come out opposite,  a 
single burry seed ball is situated 
at the end of the stem, it comes 
off easily when mature. This 
plant is very invasive in 
Kloofendal, due to the seeds 
sticking onto anything that 
brushes past them.
Treatment
Preferably take the plant out 
before it seeds. If seeds are 
present, bag the seeds and dig 
out the plants.
No slashing as the plants will 
just come up again.

Mirabilis jalapa
1b
Family: Nyctaginaceae
Common names: Four o’clock, Vieruurtjies
Herb
Origin:  Tropical America
Four o' clock is a bushy, tender 
perennial with tuberous roots 
that typically grows tall on erect, 
branching stems. It is an old 
garden favorite that features 
fragrant, funnel-shaped, tubular 
flowers with five flaring petal-like 
lobes. Flowers bloom from 
early/mid-summer to autumn. 
Flowers open in the late 
afternoon (around four o'clock) 
and stay open only until the 
following morning. (9)
It is capable of withstanding 
extended droughts due to the 
tuberous roots. The seeds and 
plant are poisonous if ingested 
(9)
It competes with indigenous 
vegetation (1)
Slightly pointed oval leaves 
which are situated opposite 
each other coming off multi-
branching stems.
Where found?
In area south of the reserve near 
the top, below a big drain from 
the adjacent road, amongst 
dried out litter and in the 
Wetland area.
Flowers come in pink, red, 
yellow, white and some bi-
coloured. They have a slight 
vanilla scent. (9)
Treatment
Unsuitable to remove with the 
tree popper as the stems are 
fleshy and break when trying to 
remove with the tree popper.
Digging out is an endless task 
as the tubers are big and deep, 
and stems break off easily, we 
have not succeeded, so 
spraying with a systemic 
herbicide, as recommended by 
Bromilow hopefully would work 
(1).
I recommend digging out young 
plants when they appear, 
thereby not allowing them to 
spread. We have tried  brush 
cutting the plants before the 
flowers produce seeds, but 
follow-up brush cutting with 
lack of workers is a problem.

Nephrolepis cordifolia
3
Family:  Nephrolepidaceae
Common names: Sword fern, Boston sword fern
Herb
Origin:Tropical forests all over 
the world, especially Central 
America & the West Indies.
Evergreen fern with ~ erect, stiff 
fronds (leaves) up to 1 m high; 
terrestrial or epiphytic (grows on 
other plants). (3)
It forms extensive colonies by 
means of stolons and produces 
tubers (3). 
                                                                       (3)
                                   Tuber
Where found?
Kloofendal amphitheatre area
 in flowerbed.
Fronds tend to be dull green in 
shaded areas and lighter green 
or yellowish-green when 
growing in a sunny position. 
Both fertile and sterile fronds 
are pinnately compound (once 
divided) and 7cm wide. 
Numerous spore containing 
structures are produced 
between the leaflet midvein and 
margin on the undersurface of 
the leaflets. (9)
Thousands of spores can be 
produced by one plant, which, 
enables this fern to spread 
aggressively, making it a threat 
to indigenous plant species. (9) 
Not to be confused with
Nephrolepis exaltata, which 
has no tubers, and longer 
leaflets, 3 -7cm, compared to 
N.cordifolia’s leaflets of  2 -
4.5cm (3). 
N. exaltata is also alien, from N. 
and C. America, most 
Nephrolepis cultivars have 
been derived from N. exaltata.
Treatment
Hand pulling, making sure all 
parts of the plant are removed 
(1).

Pteridium aquilinum
Family: Dennstaedtiaceae 
Common names: Bracken, Adelaars varing
Herb
Origin:  Indigenous to South 
Africa
A perennial, deciduous fern, 
growing into dense stands. (1)
Bracken has large, roughly 
triangular fronds (large, divided 
leaf) produced singly from an 
underground rhizome,  and 
grows to 0,3 to 1 meter tall. The 
plant dies back to ground level in 
autumn. The rhizome grows up 
to 3.5 meters deep, 5 cm in 
diameter, and up to 15 meters 
long (63)
Where found?
In Kloofendal Wetland area, and 
on western, lower part of 
reserve. In Magaliesberg near 
streams, also in open veld – 
walking up to Tonquani 
(Magaliesberg), on both sides of 
the higher section of the path.
It regrows in the spring from an 
underground rhizome, new 
growth presents as vertical 
stalks, coiled and covered with 
silver grey hairs, unfurling into 
fronds. (63) It also reproduces 
from its copious spores.
Not to be confused with
Microlepia spelucae
                                                                 (7)
Treatment
Difficult to control. Can be 
removed mechanically, by 
cutting stands repeatedly over 
six weeks cycles during active 
growing periods (1). Pulling and 
digging the plants out does not 
work, they simply break off  
from the rhizomes. 
Bromilow recommends 
systemic herbicides such as 
Imazapyr and Metsulfuron-
methyl sprayed towards the end 
of the growing season (1).

Salvia tiliifolia
1b
Family:  Lamiaceae
Common names: Lindenleaf sage
Herb
Origin: Central America 
Erect, shortly hairy, annual
herb to 1.2 m high. 
                                                               (7)
Leaves are simple, heart 
shaped, have finely serrated 
margins, in opposite pairs, each 
pair at right angles to the last (3). 
Leaves are used to kill lice.
                                        (9)                                (9)
Blue flowers, corolla 5–10 mm 
long, calyx 4–7 mm long, in 
whorled clusters along a 
terminal spike up to 25 cm long 
(3). 
Where found?
Spreading fast in Northern lower 
border of reserve and on western 
lower part of reserve next to 
paths. Mostly grows in shade.
Seeds are tiny and  many, sown 
in spring.
Not to be confused with
                                                              (7)
Plectranthus hereroensis, 
which has far more coarsely 
serrated leaf margins and grows 
as a higher herb.
Treatment
Pulling out plants loosens the 
soil facilitating germination of 
the many seeds. We are 
experimenting by cutting the 
plants preferably before they 
seed, preventing seeding, and 
keeping ground “occupied”. 
Another suggestion is, as the 
Salvias appear to like to grow in 
the shade under trees, is, to see 
if they survive when trees and 
shrubs they are growing under, 
are removed as part of Bush 
encroachment strategy.

Flat-growing herb
Origin: Asia
Knotweed is a mat-like, 
perennial, herbaceous plant 
with a slender, woody rootstock 
and long, creeping, rooting 
stems. It also spreads with 
seeds. 
It is found growing on roadsides, 
dry banks, slopes and in open 
areas, preferring full sun. It 
negatively impacts on the 
environment by forming a dense 
carpet, replacing most 
indigenous vegetation.  (9)
The hairy leaves are 1-6cm long 
and 0.7-3cm wide with a reddish 
midrib and a distinctive dark red 
V pattern. The leaves turn red 
when the plant is under stress.

Tradescantia fluminensis
1b
Family: Commelinaceae
Common names: Wandering Jew
Flat-growing herb
Origin: Mexico
Wandering jew is a trailing 
perennial. It forms a mat which 
smothers low growing plants 
and prevents the natural 
regeneration of taller forest 
species.
                                                        (74)
Grows in shade, under trees, 
forming extensive mats, that 
smother all other vegetation and 
eventually replace it .
(Bromilow, c. 2018. p 346)
It’s stems break easily at the 
nodes and establishes itself 
again. 
Where found?

                                                         (72)
It often causes skin irritations in 
humans, and dogs kept in yards 
containing Wandering jew have 
developed rashes. (9)
Treatment
Foliage is easy to remove, but 
this  must be done repeatedly,

thick stolons and rhizomes 
running along the ground and 
high up into the trees, growing 
over indigenous  vegetation, 
smothering it.
Where found?
Not in Kloofendal.  On a forest 
floor area near a stream in 
Magaliesberg, climbing right up 
the highest trees.
A pair of leaves comes off the 
branch opposite each other. In 
young branches often a tendril 
comes off at that intersection 
which winds itself onto its host 
plant.
Pink tubular flowers, flowering 
in autumn.
Not to be confused with
Mexican Blood Trumpet 
(Amphilophium buccinatorium), 
also alien,  which has the same 
flowers but red and orange in 
colour.
                                                         
Treatment
Remove by pulling up rhizomes 
& stolons from the ground, cut 
into pieces, stack up in piles to 
reduce chance of roots growing 
into the soil again. Saw/ cut 
creeper stems going up into the 
tree.

Family: Apocynaceae (Asclepiadaceae
Common names: Moth Catcher
Creeper
Origin: South America
A vigorous climber growing to 
5m or higher, overtopping and 
smothering other species. 
Leaves are dark green and 
smooth above and pale green or 
whitish below with short, dense 
hairs.
                                                        (9)
White, cream or pale pink 
flowers appear from November 
to April
The seeds and milky latex are 
poisonous, the latex can cause 
skin irritation.
Where found?
In forest, where it can climb up 
into the trees. Also, near tall 
fences, such tennis courts.
Big green seed pods, which turn 
brown and woody and split to 
release with numerous fluffy 
seeds
Not to be confused with
Pentarrhinum insipidum which 
also has a milky latex and 
similar, but a smaller seedpod 
with fluffy seeds but the leaves 
are heart shaped.
                                                         
Treatment
Dig and pull out. Remove seed 
pods before they ripen. If you 
can’t get the roots out, simply 
cut base of creeper stem, to 
stop it producing seed.

Cuscuta campestris
1b
Family: Convolvulaceae
Common names: Common dodder
Creeper
Origin: North America
Slender, leafless, parasitic herb 
with yellow or whitish, twining 
stems up to 2m high and forming 
dense patches up to 6m across.
It smothers and parasitizes other 
plants of economic importance 
in agricultural crop lands. 
Dodder has no leaves and no 
chlorophyll in its stems either, 
so is totally parasitic on its host 
plant. 
Where found?
Along northern and western 
border of Kloofendal.
Leafless annual herb, looks like 
entwined yellow string creeping 
plentifully over other vegetation 
from which it parasitizes by 
suckers (hausteria).

Hedera canariensis
3
Family: Araliaceae
Common names: Canary ivy
Creeper
Origin: Europe
This evergreen perennial can 
climb up to 10m high by means 
of rootlets on the stems, or it 
can spread over the ground to 
form a carpet.
                                                                             (9)
All parts of the plant are 
poisonous and the sap an 
irritant to the skin. (3) 
Cultivated as an ornamental and 
as a ground cover. (9)
Where found?
Not in Kloofendal but all over in 
Johannesburg in gardens, on 
pavements, on roadsides.
                                                  (9)
Leaves are bright to dark green, 
sometimes with broad silvery-
grey or white edges,  glossy 
when new, becoming leathery 
with age. They are mostly wider 
than they are long, unlobed to 
shallowly three-lobed. 
                                                  (9)
The flowers are green in 
terminal, globular umbels 
flowering from March to July, 
but seldom appear. Fruits are 
drupes, which are black when 
ripe. (9)    
                               
Treatment
Stems of Ivy climbing on trees 
can be cut and above the cut, 
be pulled away from the tree or 
wall for a few meters. The Ivy 
above the cut can be left to rot, 
it will die if not rooted in the 
ground. The remaining base 
should be treated with 
herbicide (1)

Ipomoea purpurea 
1b
Family: Convolvulaceae
Common names:  Morning glory
Creeper
Origin: Tropical America
Sterile cultivars or hybrids are 
not listed. 
A slender creeper, it climbs up 
on trees, not along the ground, 
twining to 3 meters and more, 
competing with other species. It 
is an annual plant, has less 
impact than the similar Ipomoea 
indica which is perennial. (9)
                                                              (7)
Bright green, sparsely hairy, 
heart-shaped leaves.
Purplish-blue, reddish, magenta 
or white flowers, sometimes 
with contrasting stripes, funnel-
shaped, to 85mm long. (9)
Where found?
In disturbed ground, creeping 
over or on other vegetation.
Flowers usually appear 
November  to May.
The flowers produce globose 
seeds, capsules of 10mm 
measured across.
The seed is said to contain a 
powerful hallucinogen. (1)
Not to be confused with
Not to be confused with
other Ipomoeas such as the 
indigenous Ipomoea ommaney, 
which has thick, hairy leaves 
and  crawls over the ground.
                                                         
Treatment

Jasminum mesnyi 
Family: Oleaceae
Common names: Yellow jasmin, 
Primrose jasmin
Creeper
Origin: Southwestern China.
Primrose jasmine is a rambling, 
open evergreen shrub with long, 
slender, arching stems that will 
climb like a sprawling vine if 
given support. The stems are 
square in cross section, and 
green, becoming woody with age 
(Wiki). 
                                                                            (7)
The glossy dark green leaves are 
opposite and divided into three 
leaflets. 
Where found?
Primrose jasmine is found 
growing profusely between the 
neighbouring fence bordering 
houses on Galena Street and the 
path leading from the wetland 
east wards.
                                                                         (7)
The fragrant, yellow trumpet 
shaped flowers are borne in 
early spring and sporadically 
into summer. They are semi-
double with 6-10 petals,  and 
sweetly fragrant. 
Not to be confused with
Dolichandra unguis (Cat’s claw)
Treatment
Pulling and digging out the 
entire plant & root system, a big 
task, we have not managed to 
do so in Kloofendal. It has been 
cut back as part of the firebreak 
management between 
neighbouring properties and 
Kloofendal.

Jasminum polyanthum
Family: Oleaceae (olive)
Common names: Jasmin
Creeper
Origin: West China
An evergreen vigorous climbing 
vine that grows up to mid-
canopy height. 
It has very long, non-woody, 
round, tough, stems that root at 
the nodes. 
Smooth edged leaves are 
arranged in opposite pairs on 
stems and are divided along the 
midvein into usually 7 leaflets 
with the terminal leaflet (up to 7 
x 2.5 cm) the largest. Leaves are 
dark green when mature, new 
growth is tinged with red. 
Where found?
Northern border along 
neighbouring fence and creeping 
over trees and bushes.
It has masses of highly scented, 
small white tubular flowers,  
flowering mainly in spring 
followed by occasional glossy 
black fruit. 
Treatment
Vines must be pruned as close 
to original stem as possible, 
and then the  cut stem 
immediately treated  with paint-
on herbicide – see website link. 
We would try Kaput as that is 
the only herbicide we use at 
present.
Vines can be progressively 
rolled up and disposed off at a 
refuse transfer station or by 
drying thoroughly and 
composting, or drying and 
burning, or burying deeply. 
Stem fragments must be 
removed as they, left in soil 
after rolling, will re-sprout. If so, 
these resprouted plants need to 
be pulled out manually. (88)

Lonicera japonica 
3
Family: Caprifoliaceae
Common names:  Honeysuckle 
(Japanese)
Creeper
Origin: Eastern Asia including 
China, Japan and Korea.
An aggressive climber which 
develops a mass of extensive 
underground runners and stems 
that spreads over the ground 
and climbs up trees for many 
meters smothering plants 
underneath it. It invades 
woodland and riverbanks, 
usually close to urban areas. (1)
It blocks sunlight with their 
dense canopy and eventually 
pulling down their dead hosts 
with the weight of the vine. (9)

Flowers and fruit are prolific.
Uses:
It is an effective groundcover, 
and has pleasant, strong-
smelling flowers. (9)
Where found?
On and around boundary fencing 
in the reserve on the north side
                                                                      
                                                                       (3)
Flowers of Japanese 
honeysuckle are in axillary pairs 
with corolla 1.5-5 cm long.

Parthenocissus quinquefolia 
Family: Vitaceae 
Common names: Virginia creeper
Creeper
Origin: USA
A vigorous large deciduous 
climber, invasive, overrunning 
indigenous vegetation.
Leaves in summer – green, five 
ovate fingers.
P. quinquefolia is a Greek  name.
“Parthenocissus” from Greek 
means "virgin ivy" – “inquefolia” 
means  five-leaved.
Where found?
Virginia creeper was smothering 
the big indigenous Leucosidea 
sericeas on the northern border 
of  the reserve, below the 
wetland.
In Johannesburg it is found 
growing over trees, hanging 
down obscuring pathways next 
to the road, growing onto the 
road, making it hazardous for 
pedestrians to walk there.
Leaves in autumn turn red, 
flowers inconspicuous; berries 
blue-black.
Treatment
Cut and pull out, follow up by 
pulling out new growth.

Podranea ricosaliana
Family: Bignoniaceae
Common names: Zimbabwe creeper, 
Port St Johns creeper
Creeper
Origin: Tropical regions South 
America - difficult to find its real 
origin.
A vigorous, woody, rambling, 
evergreen It sends up many tall 
strong stems — 3 to 5 m up to 
10+ m high if left  unchecked. It 
has many underground stems 
with newly sprouting plants 
coming up (89), like in 
Kloofendal, from gardens of 
neighbouring houses. The roots 
grow into the cement between 
bricks of brick walls, seriously 
damaging these walls.
Where found?
Creeper on northern side of 
wetland and eastern side of 
reserve coming from 
neighbouring gardens.
Podranea ricasoliana has 
glossy foliage and large 
bunches of fragrant lilac-pink, 
trumpet-shaped flowers.
The fruit is a long, narrow, 
straight, flattened capsule.
Moderately poisonous.
                                                    
Treatment
With a large infestation from a 
neighbouring property, we are 
experimenting cutting basal 
stems of the creeper, pulling 
the branches away from the 
wall, then leaving cut branches 
to dry out on top of the stem 
remains and roots, and when 
dry burn them and hopefully the 
numerous sucker plants will 
burn too. 
If unsuccessful, use foliar spray 
on the suckering plants. 
The suckering plants have 
impressive roots of their own 
but can be dug out, but this 
takes a lot of manpower.

Rumex saggitatus/ Acetosa saggitata
Family: Polyganaceae
Common names: Red sorrel, Arrow-
head vine
Creeper
Origin: Indigenous to South 
Africa.
Rumex sagittatus is a soft-
stemmed herbaceous 
scrambling and climbing herb 
which scrambles quickly over 
plants smothering them. It has 
prominent triangular arrow-
shaped leaves. The grooved 
green stem may be distinctly 
tinted red at times (Wiki).

The small pinkish flowers grow 
on panicles up to 15 cm long. 
These are followed by a 3-sided 
greenish 1 cm diameter pod. 
The leaves and young stems can 
be cooked and eaten and are 
sometimes cultivated as a 
vegetable in Java (Wiki).
Where found?
Disturbed areas, next to path 
western, lower part of reserve 
near little cottage.
It has a tuberous woody 
rootstock with extensive 
rhizomes.
It spreads by seed and by 
resprouting from the tuber.

Rigid leaves with prickly margins 
and a pointed tip with a large 
dark brown spine (1.5-3.5 cm 
long) (90). 
Where found?
Rocky section on northern 
border of reserve near 
neighbouring fence.
Mature plants produce a 
massive flower cluster (1-2 m 
long) on a robust flowering stem 
3-5 m tall (90).
Greenish-yellow flowers, 5-6.5 
cm long, borne in upright 
position and have 6 very large 
protruding stamens. (80)
The fruit are capsules which 
turn from green to dark brown 
or blackish in colour as they 
mature and eventually split 
open to release their seeds.
A. angustifolia reproduces by 
seed, but most of the 
reproduction is probably 
vegetative. It produces 
numerous suckers and often 
also develops plantlets (i.e. 
bulbils) on the branches of its 
flower clusters (90)

South Africa and is 
taxonomically similar to, and 
difficult to distinguish from, 
other tree cacti in the Cereus 
hexagonus complex. (9)
Tree-like cactus with sharp, little 
thorns, no leaves, only many 
stems. These stems are green to 
blue-green, often powdery when 
young, with 4–12 prominent ribs, 
sometimes broken and wavy in 
monstrous forms. (3)
Where found?
Southern border of the reserve, 
adjacent and in neighbouring 
garden
Spines are in groups of 5–10 
                                                               (3)    
                                   (9)               
Flower buds – the flowers open 
at night into white flowers. (9)
Fruits are yellowish, Orange, 
pink or red, succulent berries, ± 
6 cm long, white inside with 
small, black seeds. Its fruits 
can be eaten dried or made into 
a juice. (9)
             
New plants grow from the 
thorns on each cladode .

Cereus jamacaru (cont.)
1b
Family: Cactaceae
Common names: Queen of the night
Succulent
Not to be confused with
Euphorbia ingens (Naboom), 
whose cut stems, unlike C. 
jamacaru,  exude a milky latex.
                                                       (93)
                                                        (93) 
                                                                  
Treatment
Small plants – squash with boot 
or rock, or uproot (handle by 
roots) and hang up securely to 
dry out in fork of tree. Large 
plants – infest with mealybug, 
Hypogeococcus festerianus. 
Once infested a large plant may 
take up to 3 years to die, but will 
no longer produce viable seed, 
and will remain a source of the 
biocontrol agent in the infested 
area. (5)
Option 2. Chop down, but  the 
stem base must be dug up and 
the broken stems must all be 
checked for regrowth. It should 
then be buried deeply or burnt. 
Or sprayed or injected with 
MSMA. (1)

Opuntia ficus-indica 
1b
Family: Cactaceae
Common names: Prickly pear (sweet)
Succulent
Origin: Mexico
Flattened leaf-like stems 
(cladodes) are grey to grey-green 
and are much longer than broad, 
varying from heavily spined to 
spineless. 
The leaves are minute. (9)
                                                         (9)
Bright yellow or orange showy 
flowers appear from October to 
December. (9)
Where found?
Southern top part of reserve
                          (9)
The yellowish, turning into 
reddish, edible fruit is covered 
with minute spines (glochids) 
which are highly irritating to the 
skin (4). 
Dense infestations reduce the 
grazing potential of the land, 
causing drastic devaluation of 
agricultural land conservation 
land. The spiny cladodes can 
cause injuries to animals and 
during the fruiting season the 
minute spines (glochids) on the 
fruits can be highly irritative and 
can result in animals being 
unable to feed. (9)

Opuntia ficus-indica (cont.)
1b
Family: Cactaceae
Common names: Prickly pear (sweet)
Succulent
Treatment
(i) Biocontrol with cochineal is 
successful in Kloofendal but 
needs to be spread over more 
cacti.
(ii) Small plant – squash with 
boot or rock
(iii) Large plant – cut roots with a 
knife, kick out with boot, pick up 
with stick and wedge into tree or 
crack in rock (it will root if left in 
the soil) (5).

About the Author
Karin Spottiswoode qualified as a FGASA 1 Field Guide in 2002, has 
been involved in field guiding ever since, obtained her FGASA 3 
qualification in 2012. She assisted in training of field guides 2006 – 2009 
with Bushveld Training Adventures.
She was one of the founder members of the Friends of Kloofendal and 
started an Environmental Education Program in the Kloofendal Nature 
Reserve over weekends for family groups, people of varied interests in 
the natural environment in the form of two-hour guided nature walks 
with different topics such as birding, wildflowers, trees & shrubs, 
grasses, geology, insects, reptiles, frogs and a “hands-on” program for 
school groups during the week. Her passion has always been plants 
and over the years she developed a growing concern in the increase in 
Alien Invasive Plants in the reserve, all over Johannesburg and in the 
Magaliesberg. The Environmental Education program in Kloofendal has 
for the last eight years in part become focused on  identification of 
AIPs, distinguishing them from the indigenous similar-looking plants, 
and  trying out methods of controlling these invasive problem plants 
without using herbicides, to help the workers and students working in 
Kloofendal in AIP control.
The aim is now to extend this work over the city of Johannesburg where 
AIPs have become a huge and growing problem.
