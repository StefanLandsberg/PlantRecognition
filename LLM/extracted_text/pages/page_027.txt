Pennisetum clandestinum
1b

Family: Poacaea
Common names: Kikuyu grass
Grass

Origin: Tropical East,
Northeast and Central Africa

Category 1b in protected areas
and riparian areas. Otherwise
not listed.

Dense, mat forming perennial
grass, which spreads quickly
from stolons (creeping stems
above the ground), growing
roots from their nodes - see
picture above and below,
rhizomes (underground
creeping stems) and from seed
spread by animals and
waterflow.

Where found?
Amphitheatre lawn, disturbed
areas in the reserve such as
Southern, upper part of reserve
at sewerage leak site and place
where building structures have
been.

(9)
Flowers â€“ very small, hidden
partly by leaf sheaths, only white
feathery stigmas or anthers are
visible (3)

Not to be confused with
Cynodon dactylon/ Couch grass,
an indigenous grass, also with
many stolons and rhizomes, but
leaves are narrower and shorter,
and inflorescence is true digitate
(four or five terminal racemes/
"fingers")

Treatment
Dig out, particularly near
buildings, areas with tiling or
bricks as Kikuyu grass manages
to push its way under tiles, lifting
them, and in between bricks. It
seems to be a host to many
small ants.
