Origin: Mexico

Wandering jew is a trailing
perennial. It forms a mat which
smothers low growing plants
and prevents the natural
regeneration of taller forest
species.

(74)
Grows in shade, under trees,
forming extensive mats, that
smother all other vegetation and
eventually replace it .
(Bromilow, c. 2018. p 346)

It's stems break easily at the
nodes and establishes itself
again.
