Treatment
We use tree poppers
successfully to remove single
woody-stemmed young plants.
It is important to get plants out
before the intense suckering
root system develops. Bromilow
recommends chemical control,
such as triclopyr and imazapyr
painting onto stems or cut
stumps (1). We were partially
successful with painting Kaput
100 Gel on cut, woody, bigger
branches of older plants using
Kaput which contains the
ingredient triclopyr. Cutting and
poisoning young growth has not
worked at all. The plants' toxic
smell made some workers sick.
Biocontrol for Cestrum parqui in
South Africa has been
researched by the Weeds
Research Division of the
Agricultural Research Council
(ARC) in Pretoria and is due to
be released as I was informed
by ARC students in this field the
2024 Yebo Gogga, Amablomma
exhibition at the University of the
Witwatersrand, May 2024.
