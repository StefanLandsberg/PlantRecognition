Origin: Australia and
Tasmania, the long-leaved
wattle was cultivated in South
Africa for dune reclamation.

The Long-leaved wattle is an
evergreen shrub or spreading
tree 2-6m high. Like most
species of Australian Acacias, it
has phyllodes (enlarged,
flattened, green stalks) rather
than true leaves, which are
mostly straight, but
occasionally curved. (Wiki)

Phyllodes are bright green, up to
180mm long, with 2-5
prominent longitudinal veins.
Inflorescences occur singly or
in pairs in the phyllode axils on
stalks with a length of less than
2 mm. The cylindrical flowerspikes have length of 2 to 4.5cm
packed with bright pale yellowcoloured flowers, which flower
between June and October.

Seed pods Galls

The fruits are pods that are
beaked apically, and constricted
between the seeds (3).
Stems usually have smooth,
spherical outgrowths or galls
(caused by an introduced wasp);
the galls are green turning
brown, replacing flower and leaf
buds (3)

Not to be confused with
Acacia saligna (Port Jackson
Willow)
Replaces indigenous
vegetation in Eastern & Western
Cape, luckily not in Gauteng.
