<<COLBREAK>>
The flowers are greenish, tiny,
1mm long, arranged
in catkins, produced early in the
spring. Flowers are mostly
female and stalkless. Flowering
time is August & October.
Fruit are greenish, stalkless
capsules in catkins, shedding
sterile white hairs.
It propagates by fragmented
branches rooting along the
riverbanks.
Originally from Northern China
but introduced into South Africa
from Europe to prevent erosion
of riverbanks (1). It provides
shade, fodder, honey source
and helps to erosion control. (3)

Not to be confused with:
Indigenous Salix mucronata,
whose branches may droop but
not vertically, flowers and fruits
are stalked, leaves pale whitishgreen beneath, without a whiptip; branchlets often reddish.

Where found?
Along streams in parks in
Johannesburg.

Treatment
Unwanted plants should be cut
down and replaced with
indigenous species (1)
