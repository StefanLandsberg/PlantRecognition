and a pointed tip with a large
dark brown spine (1.5-3.5 cm
long) (90).

<<COLBREAK>>
Succulent

Mature plants produce a
massive flower cluster (1-2 m
long) on a robust flowering stem
3-5 m tall (90).
Greenish-yellow flowers, 5-6.5
cm long, borne in upright
position and have 6 very large
protruding stamens. (80)
The fruit are capsules which
turn from green to dark brown
or blackish in colour as they
mature and eventually split
open to release their seeds.

A. angustifolia reproduces by
seed, but most of the
reproduction is probably
vegetative. It produces
numerous suckers and often
also develops plantlets (i.e.
bulbils) on the branches of its
flower clusters (90)

Treatment
For small infestation, we have
dug out the small Agaves and
used a panga to hack off leaves
and damage the core of the adult
plant.
