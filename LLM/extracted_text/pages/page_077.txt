An erect evergreen shrub up to
2 m tall by 1.5 m wide, with
numerous, usually unbranched
stems growing from ground level
(Wiki).

leaflets 4–11 cm long and 1.5–
3 cm broad, with entire margins

Tiny flowers with white petals,
pinky-white sepals, flowering in
early summer, in clusters above
the leaves (Wiki).
The fruit is a bright red berry, 5–
10 mm diameter, ripening in
late autumn and often
persisting through the winter.
(Wiki)
The plant is generally
considered non-toxic to
humans, but the berries are
considered toxic to cats and
grazing animals.
Berries are used in research as
an anti-dote for Ecstasy
(addictive dangerous drug).
(Wiki).

Treatment
Not a problem in Kloofendal so
far, so no work done on it, but
my recommendation is bagging
the fruit and digging it out.
