Pink to mauve thistle-like
flowers surrounded by spiny
bracts appearing from
September to April.

Each small fluffy unit (A) is an
unopened tiny fruit (Achenes)
within a tuft of silky hairs of 2cm
long. Fruits will open up once
on the ground, releasing its
seeds.

it is recommended to bag the
seed heads, cut away spiny
leaves, then dig the plant out of
the ground. One needs to wear
thick leather gloves for
protection against the spines.
