Rubus cuneifolius & hybrids
1b

Family: Rosaceae
Common names: American bramble and hybrid
brambles

Origin: North America
Erect to sprawling, thorny shrub
growing up to 2 m high with
deeply ridged stems. Spreads
through seeds and suckering

It competes with and replaces
indigenous woody and grassland
species. Dense stands are
impenetrable and restrict
access to forestry plantations;
they also restrict access to
grazing and water by domestic
and wild animals.

Leaves are green, sometimes
densely grey-downy beneath;

Rubus cuneifolius may not
occur in Gauteng or the
Magaliesberg but its hybrids
do.(44). There are six declared
Rubus species in South Africa.
