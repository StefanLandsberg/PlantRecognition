Where found?
Spreading fast in Northern lower
border of reserve and on western
lower part of reserve next to
paths. Mostly grows in shade.
<<COLBREAK>>
Seeds are tiny and many, sown
in spring.
Not to be confused with

(7)
Plectranthus hereroensis,
which has far more coarsely
serrated leaf margins and grows
as a higher herb.

Treatment
Pulling out plants loosens the
soil facilitating germination of
the many seeds. We are
experimenting by cutting the
plants preferably before they
seed, preventing seeding, and
keeping ground "occupied".
Another suggestion is, as the
Salvias appear to like to grow in
the shade under trees, is, to see
if they survive when trees and
shrubs they are growing under,
are removed as part of Bush
encroachment strategy.
