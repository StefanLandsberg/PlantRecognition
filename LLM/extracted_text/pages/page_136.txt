Origin: Southwestern China.

Primrose jasmine is a rambling,
open evergreen shrub with long,

square in cross section, and
green, becoming woody with age

The fragrant, yellow trumpet
shaped flowers are borne in
early spring and sporadically
into summer. They are semidouble with 6-10 petals, and
sweetly fragrant.

Not to be confused with
Dolichandra unguis (Cat's claw)

Treatment
Pulling and digging out the
entire plant & root system, a big
task, we have not managed to
do so in Kloofendal. It has been
cut back as part of the firebreak
management between
neighbouring properties and
Kloofendal.
