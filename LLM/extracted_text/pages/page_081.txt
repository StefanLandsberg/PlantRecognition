Rubus cuneifolius & hybrids (cont.)
1b

Family: Rosaceae
Common names: American bramble and hybrid
brambles

Treatment
Cut prickly branches wearing
thick leather welding gloves,
elbow high, for protection and
pull, dig out, where possible
removing the underground
runners.

Mechanical control alone might
help to suppress Rubus species
but will not eradicate the plants.
Parts of stems and roots have
the potential to grow into new
plants and therefore a single
mechanical operation might
actually promote spread. (43)

Several herbicides have been
registered for use against Rubus
species, mainly as foliar
applications to actively growing
plants. (43)

There are no biological control
agents (insects or pathogens)
available for any of the Rubus
species in South Africa. (43)
