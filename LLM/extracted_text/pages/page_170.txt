About the Author

Karin Spottiswoode qualified as a FGASA 1 Field Guide in 2002, has
been involved in field guiding ever since, obtained her FGASA 3
qualification in 2012. She assisted in training of field guides 2006 â€“ 2009
with Bushveld Training Adventures.

She was one of the founder members of the Friends of Kloofendal and
started an Environmental Education Program in the Kloofendal Nature
Reserve over weekends for family groups, people of varied interests in
the natural environment in the form of two-hour guided nature walks
with different topics such as birding, wildflowers, trees & shrubs,
grasses, geology, insects, reptiles, frogs and a "hands-on" program for
school groups during the week. Her passion has always been plants
and over the years she developed a growing concern in the increase in
Alien Invasive Plants in the reserve, all over Johannesburg and in the
Magaliesberg. The Environmental Education program in Kloofendal has
for the last eight years in part become focused on identification of
AIPs, distinguishing them from the indigenous similar-looking plants,
and trying out methods of controlling these invasive problem plants
without using herbicides, to help the workers and students working in
Kloofendal in AIP control.
