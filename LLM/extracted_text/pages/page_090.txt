Family: Asteraceae
Common names: Blackjacks
Herb

Origin: South America
A common, widespread and
exceedingly troublesome

and disturbed areas. (1)

Pinnately (once divided)

rarely 5 leaflets, with sharply
toothed margins. Yellow flower
heads with or without white ray

Blackjack flower Seedhead

Barbed awns (51)
Fruits/ seeds are about 1 cm
long, with two to three stiff,
heavily barbed awns at their
distal ends allowing the seed to
burrow into clothing and hair â€“
extremely efficient method of
dispersal. (52)(1).

Where found?
Any disturbed areas in
Kloofendal.
<<COLBREAK>>
A prolific seeder, often
producing several thousand per
plant, it can complete a life
cycle (germination to shedding
of seeds) in as little as 50 days.
Viable seeds may be produced
when the plant is a few cm high.
Uses from the internet:
(i)Treatment for stinging nettle
and other skin inflammation,
rub the plant onto the affected
area.
(ii) Young leaves are eaten as a
spinach by some people (1). To
me it tastes bland.

Treatment
Ruderal weed, pioneer.
Indigenous plants will take over
in natural succession but in
disturbed areas the Blackjack
can spread effusively and grow
high. We suggest slashing the
plants about 15cm high before
they seed. This will keep the
ground covered with vegetation
preventing seeds lying around
to germinate.
Pulling out plants will promote
unwanted new growth in the
loosened soil. Pulling out the
odd plant amongst indigenous
vegetation is good, as that
allows the indigenous
vegetation to replace the
Blackjacks.
