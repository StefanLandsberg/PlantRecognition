Treatment
(i) Biocontrol with cochineal is
successful in Kloofendal but
needs to be spread over more
cacti.

(ii) Small plant – squash with
boot or rock
(iii) Large plant – cut roots with a
knife, kick out with boot, pick up
with stick and wedge into tree or
crack in rock (it will root if left in
the soil) (5).
