Origin: North America

In young Robinia pseudoacacia
the leaves are simple (left
picture below). Spines already
very vicious-looking, coming
out in pairs.

(25) (26)
In older Robinia pseudoacacias
(right picture above) the leaves
are pinnately compound,
spines coming out at base of
leaf stalks and also elsewhere
on the stem. Simple and
compound leaves are found on
the same bush. It suckers freely
and often forms thickets. (9)

Where found?
Infestation found on northeastern
border of reserve, bordering on
neighbouring gardens.

Tree

Typical white Acacia flowers in
drooping sprays from
September to November
Reddish-brown pods.

Seeds, leaves and inner bark
are poisonous.(9)

Not to be confused with
Acacias â€“ most African Acacias
have thorns, not spines (= stem
ending in a sharp point).

Treatment
Tree pop the young trees.
Cutting down tree and applying
herbicide partly works, it does
encourage more suckering, but
repeated cutting away new
growth eventually does kill the
tree.
