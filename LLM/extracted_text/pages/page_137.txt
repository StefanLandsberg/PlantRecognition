midvein into usually 7 leaflets
with the terminal leaflet (up to 7
x 2.5 cm) the largest. Leaves are
dark green when mature, new
growth is tinged with red.

<<COLBREAK>>
It has masses of highly scented,
small white tubular flowers,
flowering mainly in spring
followed by occasional glossy
black fruit.

Treatment
Vines must be pruned as close
to original stem as possible,
and then the cut stem
immediately treated with painton herbicide â€“ see website link.
We would try Kaput as that is
the only herbicide we use at
present.
Vines can be progressively
rolled up and disposed off at a
refuse transfer station or by
drying thoroughly and
composting, or drying and
burning, or burying deeply.
Stem fragments must be
removed as they, left in soil
after rolling, will re-sprout. If so,
these resprouted plants need to
be pulled out manually. (88)
