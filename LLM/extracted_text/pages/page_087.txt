tall, with stems becoming woody
at the base. Its short-stalked
leaves are opposite, simple and
egg-shaped; they can be densely
to sparsely hairy and are dark
green above and paler below,
with young leaves often
silvery.(49)

Herb

(48)
The small greenish-white
flowers, often tinged with
purple-red, form terminal
spikes, dense at first but
elongating up to 60 cm long. As
the flowers age, they bend
downwards and become
pressed closely against the
stem. (49)
The fruits are small one-seeded
capsules, orange to reddish
purple or straw-brown; with
their pointed tips, they readily
adhere to animals and clothing.

Treatment
Easily controlled by cultivation
i.e. just pull/ dig out and leave
to dry out, plant will eventually
become compost. Preferably
pull out before seeding as the
seeds are sharp and penetrate
the skin if handled carelessly.
