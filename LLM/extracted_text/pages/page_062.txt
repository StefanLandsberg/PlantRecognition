<<COLBREAK>>
This tree has the potential to be
weedy through self-seeding in
surrounding landscapes .

It has escaped intended
plantings to invade native plant
communities. The aggressive
root system absorbs water,
nutrients and space (Wiki) .

Ulmus parvifolia (Chinese Elm)
is listed in the Invasive Plant
Atlas of the United States
(Gardenia.net).

Not to be confused with
Combretums, they also have
winged seeds, but Combretum
seeds are 4 winged, not twowinged.

Treatment
It can be effectively controlled
using any of several readily
available general use
herbicides such as triclopyr or
imazapyr (Wiki). No work has
been done on these plants in
Kloofendal yet, as there are only
few there.
