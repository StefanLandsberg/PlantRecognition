Ornamental Invaders

Plants having been brought from other countries for gardening
purposes, because they look beautiful, having become invaders, when
escaping from gardens. Their propagation is made worse by
horticulturalists promoting these exotic plants over the indigenous

Indigenous Bush Encroachment

In certain conditions, mostly overgrazing, indigenous vegetation

making carrying capacity of domestic stock totally uneconomical (1). In
Kloofendal the bush encroachment is due to lack of fire, which is a
natural phenomenon on the Highveld.

Examples of indigenous Bush encroachers in the reserve are:
