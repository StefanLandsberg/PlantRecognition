My report on work done November 2020 into 202, which includes
Colleen van Rooyen's contribution in recording location of AIPs in
Kloofendal, can be accessed at
https://kloofendalfriends.org.za/alien-invasive-plant/
<<COLBREAK>>
These records were then transferred onto a spreadsheet for data
processing. Since 2022 recording is done on a GPS App on the cell, and
then exported via email to a spreadsheet for data processing which
gives numbers of AIPs pulled out, ringbarked or treated with paint-on
herbicide, date and time, with location on the Kloofendal map, an
overlay for each species. This is a new technology we are developing for
record keeping of work done.

As many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is more
efficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just focusing on
one species.

Removing AIPs does not only involve removing the plants, rootstock
and all where possible, but also removing the fruit with the seeds when
they have been formed.

This booklet includes the South African declared AIPs, as well as nondeclared invasive problem plants occurring in the Kloofendal Nature
Reserve. I have included some AIPs which do not occur in Kloofendal
but do occur in other Johannesburg green areas such as Klipriviersberg
Nature Reserve and in the Magaliesberg.
