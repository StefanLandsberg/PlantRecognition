Origin: Asia

Knotweed is a mat-like,
perennial, herbaceous plant
with a slender, woody rootstock
and long, creeping, rooting
stems. It also spreads with
seeds.
It is found growing on roadsides,
dry banks, slopes and in open
areas, preferring full sun. It
negatively impacts on the
environment by forming a dense
carpet, replacing most
indigenous vegetation. (9)

The hairy leaves are 1-6cm long
and 0.7-3cm wide with a reddish
midrib and a distinctive dark red
V pattern. The leaves turn red
when the plant is under stress.
