Indigenous birds could neglect
the dispersal of indigenous
plants as a consequence of
their preference for the fruits of
this alien.

Ligustrum japonicum where the
leaves are different and flowers
less tightly packed, looser.

Treatment
As the Privets often occur along
the water ways, we do not use
herbicide. Tree-pop the young
plants, bigger trees, saw down
low, strip bark (ringbark) to the
base where possible. Cut away
regrowth to eventually starve
the plants. Follow up.
