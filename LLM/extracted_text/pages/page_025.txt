Vigorous, tussock grass up to
3m in diameter, with flowering

wasteland. It was introduced
into South Africa to stabilize the
mine dumps and as an
ornamental plant. (9)

Leaves are bright green, with
long slender blades, which are
either flat or V-shaped. Margins
of the leaves are sharp. Some
people have allergic reaction
(bad rash) to the leaves when
trying to take out the grass. The
flowers can cause irritation to
eyes and nose and respiratory
tract.

power station on eastern side of
reserve and on the top Eastern
part of Rocky Ridge (Yellow) Trail
next to path.

yellowish or purple, loosely

Treatment
Cut off the flowers before
seeding, bag them, leave to rot
in a closed- up garbage bag. Dig
out stumps, which is a huge job
because of its rhizomatous
roots. We find a pinch bar
(gwala) useful in digging the
plant out. First cutting off the
leaves with a panga makes
digging out the stumps easier.
