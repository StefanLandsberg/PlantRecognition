Disposal of AIPs
<<COLBREAK>>
7.
Sites with AIPs often seem to collect litter â€“ litter should be removed
from those sites, so plastic bags for litter collection and a litter
picker is advisable to take to the weeding site.

8.
A small First Aid kit (rubber gloves, cotton wool, gauze, clean water,
antiseptic, and plaster of various sizes) is useful for possible minor
cuts or abrasions whilst working on AIPs.

i.
AIPs that have been pulled out roots and all, and branches
that have been cut, can be left on site to decompose, with
the exception of the Opuntias and Cereus.

ii.
Where manageable, fruit and seeds must be put in plastic
bags ("bagged"), the full bag knotted closed, and taken to
a garbage disposal site, where they will rot. The fruit and its
seeds must not be left on site, as they will sprout and grow
again. DO NOT attempt to burn dry seeds! Hot air rises and
will take dry seeds with them, the breeze will disperse
them, and a new hot spot of that plant will be created e.g.
Pompom weed seeds.
