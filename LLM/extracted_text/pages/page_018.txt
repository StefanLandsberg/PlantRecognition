Information on herbicides for AIPs can be found in "Problem
Plants and Invasive Weeds in Southern Africa" by Clive Bromilow,
2018 edition (1). FroK uses Kaput gel, which is a water-based painton herbicide. The herbicide application and safety instructions
must be followed. It is important to apply the herbicide within ten
minutes of cutting the tree as it loses effectiveness if applied later.
