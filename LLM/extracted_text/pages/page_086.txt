<<COLBREAK>>
Shrub

(97) (9)
Seedpods, initially green,
turning brown, splitting open to
release papery winged seeds. (9)

Treatment
Remove seed pods and bag
them. Cutting down the multistemmed bush with loppers,
secateurs and saw, trying tree
popping and digging out has not
worked for us.
Bromilow, (1) does state that T.
stans is very difficult to control
with herbicides. We will
probably experiment painting
herbicide on freshly cut stems,
see if it works.
