Treatment
Bag flowers & seeds.
Dig out small plants. For
medium size plants use tree
popper, which works well. Use
secateurs to cut way branches
in the way of taking plants out,
then use tree popper to pull
them out. Big ones cut down
and paint herbicide on stump.
No slashing as it will just
coppice prolifically. Wear elbow
length leather gloves for thorn
protection.
Biocontrol is available, but only
slightly reduces the rate of
control. (36)
