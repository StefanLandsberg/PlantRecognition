Recommended methodology on removing AIPs

1.
Wear clothing that does not attract burs such as Forget-me-not
seeds, Black jacks, Burweed, grass seeds, so do not wear -stretchy
material, nor knitted clothing. It is recommended to wear gaiters to
cover socks and shoelaces. Hair to be covered by a hat, braids and
loose hair to be tied back and covered by a hat. Suncream is
recommended, as well as bringing something to drink.

2.
Welding gloves (elbow high, thick leather gloves, usually blue) to be
worn when working with prickly plants such as Lantana camara,
Solanum sysimbriifolium, American Bramble, Scotch thistle as well
as with plants that have allergenic properties such as Bugweed
hairs and sap of Cestrum and Mothcatcher.

3.
Do not wear leather gloves when working on plants that have burs,
as burs stick onto these gloves.

4.
Rubber gloves and mask to be worn when using herbicides.
Protective glasses optional â€“ we do not use herbicide spray, only
the paint-on one.

5.
People working on the AIPs need to be warned that many plants are
toxic, so that, after working on these plants, hands need to be
washed before eating, also no rubbing of eyes or nose with
contaminated hands.

6.
As many species all like to grow in the same disturbed area, it is
more efficient to work on all of them in an area rather than just
focusing on one species.
