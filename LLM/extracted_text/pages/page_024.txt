<<COLBREAK>>
Arundo donax
1b

Family: Poaceae
Common names: Giant or Spanish reed
Grass

Broad lobes at leaf base.
Not to be confused with
Phragmites australis which
grows up to 4 meters high, so is
much shorter than A. donax.
P. australis and A. donax both
grow in or near sources of water
but A. donax often occurs on
sites away from water (3)
P. australis has not got broad
lobes at leaf base
P.australis' inflorescence is
more open and feathery.

Treatment
C. Bromilow suggests cutting
the reeds to ground level, stack
the branches and preferably
burn them. Caution not to use as
stakes for the garden as pieces
can regrow. Allow reeds to grow
1-2 meters, which usually takes
6-8 weeks, before applying a
recommended systemic
herbicide. Thorough follow-up is
essential for effective control.
Observe any restrictions on the
herbicide label before
subsequent water use. (1)
