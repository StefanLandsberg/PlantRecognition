Lots of fluffy seeds.

Treatment
Conyza sumatrensis is a
pioneer, a ruderal weed, which
should get overtaken by
indigenous vegetation. In
Kloofendal, however, it is
overtaking the grasses, so
pulling them out gives grasses
more chance to come back. We
have not tried this yet.
Bromilow suggests the use of
herbicides if Conyza becomes
a problem (1).
