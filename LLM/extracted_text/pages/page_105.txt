<<COLBREAK>>
Fronds tend to be dull green in
shaded areas and lighter green
or yellowish-green when
growing in a sunny position.
Both fertile and sterile fronds
are pinnately compound (once
divided) and 7cm wide.
Numerous spore containing
structures are produced
between the leaflet midvein and
margin on the undersurface of
the leaflets. (9)

Thousands of spores can be
produced by one plant, which,
enables this fern to spread
aggressively, making it a threat
to indigenous plant species. (9)

Not to be confused with
Nephrolepis exaltata, which
has no tubers, and longer
leaflets, 3 -7cm, compared to
N.cordifolia's leaflets of 2 -
4.5cm (3).
N. exaltata is also alien, from N.
and C. America, most
Nephrolepis cultivars have
been derived from N. exaltata.

Treatment
Hand pulling, making sure all
parts of the plant are removed
