What is the problem with AIPs?

1.
It is against the law (NEMBA AIS Regulations – see below)

2.
AIPs replace our indigenous vegetation, sometimes in a big way!
Alien invasive species, which includes plants, animals and other
organisms, are responsible for a quarter of South Africa's
indigenous biodiversity loss.

Pompom weed, Campuloclinium macrocephalum, invading grassland.

3.
AIPs take up a lot of water. Research has shown significant current
water losses due to the impact of alien invasive plants. It is
estimated that the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS)
currently loses about ±38 million m3/annum through these
impacts (equivalent to the capacity of Wemmershoek Dam).

4.
AIPs often grow into big trees, thereby consuming extra lots of
water, as compared to our indigenous plants which mostly do not
tend to get as big e.g. Black Woods, mature Black and Silver Wattle
trees, Eucalyptus trees, Pine trees etc.

5.
Riparian invasions use water in rivers and use can exceed the
rainfall. Dense black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) invasion is
estimated to result in a 90–100% reduction in annual river flows (3).

6.
AIPs are often poisonous, unpalatable, dangerous to animals and
plants, such as Cestrum parqui, Datura stramonium. Ripe fruits
and seeds of some AIPs might be palatable to birds or insects,
aiding in the AIP's seed dispersal.
