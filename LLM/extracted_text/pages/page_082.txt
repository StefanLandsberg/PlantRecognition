In wetland.

The creamy-white flowers are
small.

The fruit is a small berry-like
drupe, which begins green, then
turns reddish and eventually
purplish-black.

Treatment
Tree pop small plants, bigger
trees, cut low and damage
stump, strip bark to the roots
with a panga - we are trying out
that method as Sambucus is
growing in the wetland, so we
do not use herbicide there.
