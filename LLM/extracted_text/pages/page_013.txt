National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act
AIS â€“ Alien Invasive Species
Law passed in 2014, updated in 2020

Listed invasive species are assigned to four categories:
Category 1a:
Species which must be combatted or eradicated
<<COLBREAK>>
NEMBA AIS Regulations

Category 1b:
Species which must be controlled
Authorized officials must be permitted to enter properties to monitor,
assist with or implement the control of listed species

Any Category 2 listed species (where permits are applicable) which fall
outside of containment and control, revert to Category 1b and must be
controlled.
Any Category 3 listed species which occur within a Protected Area or
Riparian (wetland) revert to Category 1b and must be controlled.

Category 2:
Any species listed under Category 2 requires a permit issued by the
Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment (DFFE) to carry
out a restricted activity (See Permit Applications.)

Category 3:
Category 3 listed invasive species are subject to certain exemptions in
terms of section 70 (1)(a) of the NEMBA Act, which applies to the listing
of alien invasive species.
Any Category 3 listed plant species that occurs in riparian areas, must
be considered as Category 1b and the appropriate control measures
instituted.
