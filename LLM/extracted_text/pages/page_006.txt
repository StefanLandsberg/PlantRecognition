I have compiled this booklet on identification and control of AIPs with
the aid of experts as well as various people working on AIPs elsewhere
in Johannesburg.

In a four months AIP control project starting in November 2020, and
subsequent AIP control work in Kloofendal, a daily record was kept of
the different species and number of plants removed of each species
and their location in the reserve, initially in recording books.

Introduction

This booklet is based on declared alien invasive plants and other
problem invasive plants found in the Kloofendal Nature Reserve, which
is in the western part of Johannesburg, and in the Magaliesberg
mountains.

As part of the Friends of Kloofendal, which was founded in August 2002,
I have been very involved in the control of Alien Invasive Plants (AIPs) in
Kloofendal Nature Reserve for many years, supported by Johannesburg
City Parks management of the reserve, members of the Friends of
Kloofendal, other volunteers, students, scout groups and EPWP
workers employed by Johannesburg City Parks& Zoo. This booklet was
started as an aid towards teaching volunteers and workers how to
identify the Alien Invasive Plants inside the Kloofendal Reserve and
distinguish them from similar looking indigenous plant species.

I have been reluctant in the use of herbicides as they do have an impact
on life of plants, animals (insects) and fungi close to the AIP to be
targeted. Our methodology in removal of AIPs since November 2020
has been mechanical in the form of simply pulling out small plants
where possible and using tree poppers for bigger plants. Trees too big
for removal by a tree popper have been sawn or cut down, bark
stripped down to the roots if single-stemmed. Multiple-stemmed trees
simply cut down, with a two monthly follow-up cutting away regrowth â€“
a few of such follow-ups are required for the tree to be starved and die.
Alternatively, we use paint-on herbicide on cut multi-stemmed trees.

Mechanical control is a big task but, judging by the mixed success seen
in previous use of herbicides in AIP control, the mechanical method
looks more effective and is far less harmful to the natural environment.
