A fat taproot, which grows down
deeply, difficult to dig or pull out!

Treatment
Dig out when plants are young.
Tree popper to pull plants out
does not work as the plants have
fleshy stems, the popper just
slips off. We try hacking it with a
panga, also repeated cutting
away new growth to eventually
starve the plant.
