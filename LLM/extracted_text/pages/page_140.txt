Podranea ricosaliana

Family: Bignoniaceae
Common names: Zimbabwe creeper,
Port St Johns creeper

Origin: Tropical regions South
America - difficult to find its real
origin.

A vigorous, woody, rambling,
evergreen It sends up many tall
strong stems â€” 3 to 5 m up to
10+ m high if left unchecked. It
has many underground stems
with newly sprouting plants
coming up (89), like in
Kloofendal, from gardens of
neighbouring houses. The roots
grow into the cement between
bricks of brick walls, seriously
damaging these walls.

Where found?
Creeper on northern side of
wetland and eastern side of
reserve coming from
neighbouring gardens.

Creeper

Podranea ricasoliana has
glossy foliage and large
bunches of fragrant lilac-pink,
trumpet-shaped flowers.

The fruit is a long, narrow,
straight, flattened capsule.
Moderately poisonous.

Treatment
With a large infestation from a
neighbouring property, we are
experimenting cutting basal
stems of the creeper, pulling
the branches away from the
wall, then leaving cut branches
to dry out on top of the stem
remains and roots, and when
dry burn them and hopefully the
numerous sucker plants will
burn too.
If unsuccessful, use foliar spray
on the suckering plants.
The suckering plants have
impressive roots of their own
but can be dug out, but this
takes a lot of manpower.
