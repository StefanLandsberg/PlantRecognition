Work done must be measured to prove that work has been done.

What tools are needed to remove the plants.

Forward planning – what should replace the plants taken out?
<<COLBREAK>>
Need for recording work done on removing AIPs.

Management plan – in order to know what plants are alien or other
invasive problematic plants in the area of management, one needs to
be able to identify the plants, hence this book.

Quantity or number of plants in that area – counting each plant of a
species that needs to be removed - if numbers are too big to count
individually, one has to estimate how many there are.

Location – where exactly these plants are growing – GPS recordings are
far more accurate than just a description, but descriptions are useful
additions. Recording methodology will be discussed in the next pages.

Same to be done on each invasive, problematic plant in the located
area.

How to dispose of them – stop the spread of seeds or root suckers.

Workers to have a ‘hands-on" manager who ensures that the work is
done properly. The manager needs to be familiar with the invasive
plants to be removed, the methodology, the recording procedure and
how to pass on work done by the workers onto their contractor and
other management.

Follow-up – 3 monthly, 6 monthly or yearly, and recording of the
hopeful improvement of the infested area. Comparison, this is part of
the original management plan.

Ongoing recording of location and numbers of plants removed, as well
as observations of the occurrence of other, new problem invasive
plants in the area of work.
