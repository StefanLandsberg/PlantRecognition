The yellowish, turning into
reddish, edible fruit is covered
with minute spines (glochids)
which are highly irritating to the
skin (4).

Dense infestations reduce the
grazing potential of the land,
causing drastic devaluation of
agricultural land conservation
land. The spiny cladodes can
cause injuries to animals and
during the fruiting season the
minute spines (glochids) on the
fruits can be highly irritative and
can result in animals being
unable to feed. (9)
