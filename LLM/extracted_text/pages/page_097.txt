Cyathula uncinulata

Family: Amaranthaceae
Common names: Ronde klits, Burr weed
Herb

Origin: Tropical Africa and
South Africa, excluding Gauteng
& Northwest province. (Wiki)

A perennial weed with burrs that
contaminate hair & wool of
animals with consequent
downgrading (53)

Burrs on these plants often
obstruct removing the declared
Alien Invasive Plants, hence the
need to remove them in order to
gain access.

Where found?
In the wetland, below Dassie
Rock, in the forest under trees.
<<COLBREAK>>
The leaves are furry and soft,
they come out opposite, a
single burry seed ball is situated
at the end of the stem, it comes
off easily when mature. This
plant is very invasive in
Kloofendal, due to the seeds
sticking onto anything that
brushes past them.

Treatment
Preferably take the plant out
before it seeds. If seeds are
present, bag the seeds and dig
out the plants.
No slashing as the plants will
just come up again.
