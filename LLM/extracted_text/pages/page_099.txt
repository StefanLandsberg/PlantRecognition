Family: Boraginaceae
Common names: Forget-me-not
Herb

Origin: Yemen, Pakistan, India,
Mediterranean, Asia and
Madagascar, growing in
disturbed habitats throughout
parts of Africa widely in all S.
African provinces (Wiki).

Many little blue flowers which
become green fruits which dry
out to become burr seeds which
stick onto anything that comes
past. They grow in the same
disturbed areas where the
declared AIPs grow,
obstructing the removal of these
plants.

Leaves bluishâ€“green with
distinct central and lateral veins.
