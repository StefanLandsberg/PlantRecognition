cylindrical, unbranched, needlelike stems, called "cladodes".(8)

The leaves are modified curved
thorns.

The fruits are globose, bright
red with 1-3 black seeds. (8)

(42)
The root system is
a crown with numerous fleshy
tuber-like roots coming off it.

Not to be confused with
Protoasparagus setaceus
which is a perennial climber
with soft feathery appearance,
no spines except on old, main
branches. "Leaves" (cladodes)
are short â€“ less than 10mm
long, and very fine.

Treatment: Wear good leather
gloves. With secateurs cut away
the prickly branches, cut into
smaller pieces and move away
from site. With pinch bar
(gwala) dig out the big root
system, hard work but works
well!
