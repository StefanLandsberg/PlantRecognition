(47)

A sprawling, much-branched,
grey shrub. Looking closer, one
notices that the slender, wiry
branches are softly woody and
at right angles to the stem. The
short shoots are covered with
whitish, woolly, clustered
leaves, which are minute, tufted
and pressed to the stem, giving
the plant a granular appearance
(SANBI)
It invades arid and semi-arid
grasslands. As it is unpalatable,
it reduces the carrying capacity
there.

Where found?
Throughout reserve, part of
biodiversity, not considered a
problematic encroacher plant in
the reserve.

Treatment
Salt can be sprinkled at the
base of each stem; it alters the
salinity enough to inhibit
growth.
Thick infestations can be
burned, regrowth sprayed and
slashed. Follow-up treatments
and the adoption of proper land
management practices are
critical factors for long-term
control. (1)
