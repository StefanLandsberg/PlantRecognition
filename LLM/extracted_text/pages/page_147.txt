Treatment
Small plants – squash with boot
or rock, or uproot (handle by
roots) and hang up securely to
dry out in fork of tree. Large
plants – infest with mealybug,
Hypogeococcus festerianus.
Once infested a large plant may
take up to 3 years to die, but will
no longer produce viable seed,
and will remain a source of the
biocontrol agent in the infested
area. (5)
Option 2. Chop down, but the
stem base must be dug up and
the broken stems must all be
checked for regrowth. It should
then be buried deeply or burnt.
Or sprayed or injected with
MSMA. (1)
