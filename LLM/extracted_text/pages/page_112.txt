Common names: Bracken, Adelaars varing
Herb

Origin: Indigenous to South
Africa

A perennial, deciduous fern,
growing into dense stands. (1)

Bracken has large, roughly
triangular fronds (large, divided
leaf) produced singly from an
underground rhizome, and
grows to 0,3 to 1 meter tall. The
plant dies back to ground level in
autumn. The rhizome grows up
to 3.5 meters deep, 5 cm in
diameter, and up to 15 meters
long (63)

Where found?
In Kloofendal Wetland area, and
on western, lower part of
reserve. In Magaliesberg near
streams, also in open veld â€“
walking up to Tonquani
(Magaliesberg), on both sides of
the higher section of the path.
<<COLBREAK>>
It regrows in the spring from an
underground rhizome, new
growth presents as vertical
stalks, coiled and covered with
silver grey hairs, unfurling into
fronds. (63) It also reproduces
from its copious spores.

Not to be confused with
Microlepia spelucae

(7)
Treatment
Difficult to control. Can be
removed mechanically, by
cutting stands repeatedly over
six weeks cycles during active
growing periods (1). Pulling and
digging the plants out does not
work, they simply break off
from the rhizomes.
Bromilow recommends
systemic herbicides such as
Imazapyr and Metsulfuronmethyl sprayed towards the end
of the growing season (1).
