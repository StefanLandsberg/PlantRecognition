Tools

Tree popper used to "pop
out" Lantana rootstock

▪
Tree popper to pull out, roots and all, young AIP trees and shrubs.
Three sizes are available, the bigger size to be used on bigger
plants. Tree poppers do not work on herbs as those have a fleshy
stem, which breaks easily when trying to "pop" them out.

▪
Strong small weeding tool – to dig out herbs and young shrubs. A
long, strong screwdriver can also be useful.

▪
Secateurs to cut away branches that are in the way.
