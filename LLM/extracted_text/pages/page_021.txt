We are experimenting with quantifying places where AIPS still need to
be removed by entering a negative number in the place of the number
removed.

A free on-line programme on https://www.earthpoint.us/ can be used
to generate a file for plotting records in Google Earth. This programme
allows for a wider range of icons exported by GPS Essentials as well as
colours and symbol sizes

Documenting AIPs (Continued)

AIP removal has been recorded by more than eight people to date using
the GPS Essential app. The recordings are exported by email or
WhatsApp to Dr Steve Spottiswoode as KML format file. He reads these
files and adds new records to a master CSV file using custom-written
software. Further processing is under development to expand analysis
and reporting of the data. This includes clustering and filtering of
locations in space and time.
