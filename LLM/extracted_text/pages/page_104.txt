Mirabilis jalapa
1b

Family: Nyctaginaceae
Common names: Four o'clock, Vieruurtjies
Herb

Origin: Tropical America

Four o' clock is a bushy, tender
perennial with tuberous roots
that typically grows tall on erect,
branching stems. It is an old
garden favorite that features
fragrant, funnel-shaped, tubular
flowers with five flaring petal-like
lobes. Flowers bloom from
early/mid-summer to autumn.
Flowers open in the late
afternoon (around four o'clock)
and stay open only until the
following morning. (9)

It is capable of withstanding
extended droughts due to the
tuberous roots. The seeds and
plant are poisonous if ingested
(9)

It competes with indigenous
vegetation (1)

Slightly pointed oval leaves
which are situated opposite
each other coming off multibranching stems.

Where found?
In area south of the reserve near
the top, below a big drain from
the adjacent road, amongst
dried out litter and in the
Wetland area.
<<COLBREAK>>
Flowers come in pink, red,
yellow, white and some bicoloured. They have a slight
vanilla scent. (9)

Treatment
Unsuitable to remove with the
tree popper as the stems are
fleshy and break when trying to
remove with the tree popper.
Digging out is an endless task
as the tubers are big and deep,
and stems break off easily, we
have not succeeded, so
spraying with a systemic
herbicide, as recommended by
Bromilow hopefully would work
(1).
I recommend digging out young
plants when they appear,
thereby not allowing them to
spread. We have tried brush
cutting the plants before the
flowers produce seeds, but
follow-up brush cutting with
lack of workers is a problem.
